 21 Beacon Street. ,Series, Crime Drama, NBC," The David Chase Detective Agency is a sophisticated organization located at 21 Beacon Street in Boston. It is run by David Chase; he is assisted by Lola, Brian and Jim. David is a former World War II intelligence officer for the O.S.S. (Office of Strategic Services) who now uses his skills in the private sector to help people in trouble. He tackles each case as if it were a military operation. Elaborate cons are established to outwit confidence men; complex stings are set up to bring criminals to justice; and well-calculated maneuvers are used to help the police nab killers. While David actively participates in each caper, he also oversees its operations and demands that each of his operatives follow strict protocol. Once a case has been established, the program becomes a ""Mission: Impossible""-type of series with the team executing complex maneuvers to accomplish their goal. Viewing requires strict attention to follow the plot. While the Chase team works for the public, the police and the Gravestake Insurance Company, it appears they are only hired because they are the last hope anyone has. Once a case has been accepted, the program details the step-by-step planning, its execution and the apprehension of the sought culprit. Lola, also called Jo, is a former chorus girl (Broadway and Las Vegas) who uses her skills (her beauty) for distraction. Brian and Jim are experts at disguises and knowledgeable in the art of cons.

 77 Sunset Strip. ,Series, Crime Drama, ABC," Bailey and Spencer, Private Investigators is a detective agency located at 77 Sunset Strip in Hollywood, California. Stuart Bailey and Jeff Spencer head the agency. They are assisted by Rex Randolph, Gerald Lloyd Kookson III and Suzanne Fabray. Stuart, called Stu, occupies office 101. He was a former OSS (Office of Strategic Services) agent and now lives in Apartment 301 at the Sunset DeViUa. Stu is a bit reluctant to use force and relies on his intelligence training to accomplish his goals during a case. Jeff occupies office 102. He reads Playboy magazine (surprisingly ""not for the articles"") and $50 is the top price he pays a snitch for information. Jeff and Stu have an eye for the ladies, and girls often tell Jeff ""You're too cute to be a snoop."" Jeff is more adept at physical heroics than Stu, whom he sometimes calls""The Professor"" for his intelligence and ability to speak several languages. Gerald Lloyd Kookson III, better known as Kookie, is the parking lot attendant at Dino's Lodge, the supper club next to 77 Sunset Strip. Kookie lives at 18026 Valley Hart Drive with his unseen mother, Helen Margaret Kookson, a public stenographer; his father is deceased. Kookie drives a hot rod and uses hip talk; for example, ""Squaresville, Man""; ""Like Man, let's get out of here"" and ""I don't dig it."" He refers to Jeff and Stu as ""Hey, Dad"" and pretty girls are ""Dreamboats."" Trouble is ""Troublesville."" Kookie had a way of combing his hair that drove teenage girls in the viewing audience crazy; the song, ""Kookie, Kookie, Lend Me Your Comb"" became a hit. In fourth season episodes, Kookie quits the parking lot business to become partners with Jeff and Stu. J.R. Hale replaced Kookie as the new parking lot attendant at Dino's. Suzanne is a gorgeous French girl who operates the Sunset Answering Service from office 103 at 77 Sunset Strip. She is also a public stenographer and lives in Apartment 217 at 1521/2 North Maple Street, later address given as 236 North Maple, Apartment B. Suzanne works occasionally for Stu or Jeff in an undercover capacity. Roscoe is a stool pigeon who provides information to Stu and Jeff. He was born in the Bronx, New York, and is addicted to gambling. He calls Suzanne ""Frenchy."" Roy Gilmore, called Gil, is a lieutenant with the Homicide Bureau of the L.A.P.D. He sometimes regrets the job and says, ""I should have taken my father's advice and studied air conditioning instead of Nick Carter books."" Stu and Jeff sometimes work for the Pacific Casualty Insurance Company in San Francisco and Pacific Orient Insurance in Los Angeles. In 1963 (to 1964) the format changed to focus on Stu Bailey as a private detective on his own. Although the title remained unchanged, Stu now had an office in downtown Los Angeles in a building called both the Bradbury Building and the Bedford Building. The theme also changed from a snappy vocal composed by Mack David and Jerry Livingston to a musical composition by Bob Thompson. Stu now had a secretary named Hannah and stories were told in a flashback manner. As Stu talked to Hannah, a flashback was used to tell the story. When the flashback ended, Stu and Hannah returned to sum up the case.

 'Stu Bailey and Jeff Spencer were the wisecracking, womanizing private detective heroes of this Warner Brothers drama. Stu and Jeff worked out of an office located at 77 Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, right next door to a snazzy restaurant where Kookie worked as a valet. The finger-snapping, slang-talking Kookie occasionally helped Stu and Jeff with their cases, and eventually became a full-fledged member of the detective agency. Rex Randolph and J.R. Hale also joined the firm, and Suzanne was their leggy secretary.']","[""The restaurant, Dino's Lodge, was then owned by 'Dean Martin (I)' (qv). Before it was torn down in 1989, it was located at 8524 Sunset (near Alta Loma) in Los Angeles, California.""
 'This series was produced by Warner Brothers for ABC and the episode ""The Kookie Caper"" (episode 2.2, October 9, 1959) has some inside jokes about other series produced by that studio for ABC. Early in episode, Kookie (\'Edd Byrnes\' (qv) indicates that he doesn\'t know that \'Will Hutchins\' (qv) is the star of _""Sugarfoot"" (1957)_ (qv). Later, he can be seen reading an issue of TV Guide, with the stars of _""Maverick"" (1957)_ (qv), \'James Garner (I)\' (qv) and \'Jack Kelly (I)\' (qv), on the cover. Both of those shows were produced by Warner Brothers, as was this one.'
 ""The network handed the creative reigns of the show over to 'Jack Webb (I)' (qv) and 'William Conrad (I)' (qv) for the show's final season. Webb and Conrad proceeded to fire the entire cast except 'Efrem Zimbalist Jr.' (qv), and re-molded his character Stu Bailey into an international spy.""
 ""The character of Stu Bailey originally appeared in one novel and three short stories written by Series Creator 'Roy Huggins (I)' (qv).""
 'Sponsors included Anacin aspirin, Certs breath mints"" with the golden drop of Retsyn"", and Salem Cigarettes.'
 'The ""Dino\'s Lodge"", that featured performances in numerous episodes, often includes the \'Frankie Ortega\' (qv) Trio. The trio were a Los Angeles-based three-piece jazz band signed with Warner Brothers Records, and that often headlined at the real-life Dino\'s during their heyday of the 1950s and 60s.'
 ""The building in which the detectives' offices were located was, in real-life, the home of the Mary Webb Davis modelling agency. The front of the building, the Dino's Lodge driveway, and part of Dino's, were reproduced on a Warner Brothers soundstage, which is where most of the scenes that took place in that area were filmed. The doorknob on the real door was on the left, and that's where it was on the mock-up in the earliest episodes. Later, for some reason, they moved the knob on the soundstage version to the right. The Mary Webb Davis office was eventually replaced by the Tiffany Theatre. The building has since been torn down.""
 ""This was the first of Warner Brothers' formulaic detective series. ABC was so impressed with its success, that they ordered three identical series that differed only in their sunny locales: Bourbon Street Beat (1959), Hawaiian Eye (1959) and Surfside Six (1960). A fourth series, The Roaring 20's (1960) added variety, by taking place in another era.""
 ""Even though Dino's Lodge is shown in every episode, Dean Martin, who owned the lodge, was never on the show, nor even mentioned.""
 ""The ownership battle over the rights to this show was the reason that Roy Huggins left Warner Brothers. He'd created the concept behind the series, and Selby was his creation, but the pilot episode was released theatrically, and had not been written by Huggins at all. lt was a Warner Brothers property because the actual writer had been working for hire and had no legal claim to it, and so legal ownership of the show belonged to them.""
 ""The 6th season shows Stu's office in The Bradbury Building ,a Los Angeles landmark.""

 The Adventures of Superman. ,Series, Adventure, Syn.," As the theme music (written by Leon Klatzkin) plays, an announcer begins the program: ""Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" Voices are then heard: ""Look, up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman."" The announcer returns: ""Yes, it's Superman, strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands. And who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fightsa never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American Way."" But who is Superman _æ and where did he come from? The story begins many years ago on a distant planet called Krypton, which is inhabited by a race of super intelligent beings. Jor-El (Robert Rockwell) is a leading scientist who believes the planet is being drawn closer to its sun and destruction. When he is unable to convince the Council of Scientists of his beliefs, he begins developing a rocket ship to save his wife, Lara (Aline Towne) and their infant son, Kal-El, from the impending disaster. Jor-El, however, has only time to complete a small, experimental rocket before the planet is struck by earthquakes. He and Lara decide to save Kal-El. The baby is placed in the rocket and Jor-El programs it to land on Earth, a planet he knows is inhabited. Shortly after the rocket is launched. Krypton explodes and scatters billions of particles of Kryptonite, the only substance that will be able to harm Kal-El, into the universe. The rocket enters the Earth's atmosphere on April  10, 1926, and crash lands near the Jones farm in Smallville, Kansas. Eben and Sarah Kent (Tom Fadden, Dina Nolan), a childless farm couple, witness the landing. Eben risks his life to save the baby from the burning rocket. The baby, wrapped in red and blue blankets, is miraculously unharmed. The rocket explodes seconds later, destroying all evidence of its ever having been there. Realizing that no one would ever believe their fantastic story, Eben and Sarah decide to raise the baby as their own and name him Clark Kent. As young Clark (Stuart Randall) begins to grow, he develops amazing powers (X-ray vision, incredible strength, the ability to fly). In 1951, following Eben's death from a heart attack, Sarah urges Clark to use his great abilities to help mankind. Before Sarah moves in with her cousin, Louise, she makes Clark a costume from the blankets that were originally wrapped around him (how she managed to cut and sew the indestructible material was not explained). To keep his true identity a secret, he maintains the alias of mild-mannered Clark Kent and moves to Metropolis, where he becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, a crusading newspaper. Clark lives in Apartment 5H of the Standish Arms Hotel. While it appeared that Sarah had made only one costume for Clark in the pilot (""Superman on Earth""), later episodes show that Clark has three Superman costumes in his secret closet (located behind a false wall in his regular closet). Lois Lane is the Daily Planet reporter always in distress. She was born in the small town of Cliftonby-the-Sea and now lives in Apartment 6A. She suspects that Clark is Superman but can't prove it (she believes that every time Clark disappears in an emergency to become Superman, he is a coward _æ ""Looking for a hole to hide in, Clark?""). Jimmy Olsen was originally depicted as the paper's photographer, then a cub reporter. He has the middle name of Bartholomew and lives with his mother in an undisclosed location. Like Lois, he too faces perilous situations and must be rescued by Superman. Perry White is the editor of the Daily Planet. He was a top notch reporter, then the mayor of Metropolis before becoming editor. ""Great Caesar's Ghost"" is the expression Perry uses when he becomes upset or angry; and ""Don't Call Me Chief!"" is what he yells at Jimmy for constantly calling him ""Chief."" William ""Bill"" Henderson is the police inspector who is most helped by Superman. Professor Twiddle (Sterling HoUoway) and Professor J.J. Pepperwinkle (Phillips Tead) are slightly off-center scientists who complicate Clark's life with their wacky inventions. The series is based on the comic strip by Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster.

Other Kryptonians wore parts of the costumes of Captain Marvel (from _Adventures of Captain Marvel (1941)_ (qv)) and Captain America (from _Captain America (1944)_ (qv)) among others.'
 'It is now common knowledge that Clark Kent\'s Earth parents were named Jonathan and Martha. However, in the first episode, _""Adventures of Superman"" (1952) {Superman on Earth (#1.1)}_ (qv), Kent\'s parents were named Eben and Sarah. This is because the comics themselves were inconsistent with the Kents\' given names until the characters became major players in ""Superboy"" comics stories at about this same time. The names Sarah and Eben were first used in the novel ""The Adventures of Superman"" (1942) and in the first Superman serial.'
 ""'Phyllis Coates' (qv) played the role of Lois Lane in the first season. When Coates left the series, she was replaced by 'Noel Neill' (qv) who had already played the role in the earlier movie serials.""
 'A different shot of a train was used intermittently on a few of the first episodes in the first season for the opening credits over the famous ""more powerful than a locomotive"" line.'
 ""In the early episodes, 'George Reeves (I)' (qv) wore glasses without lenses in them when he played Clark Kent. As he got older Reeves eventually needed a real prescription for eyeglasses, so he began wearing his own glasses, as can be seen in many later episodes when you can see the stage lights being reflected off the lenses.""
 'The first seasons were created by a team experienced in the production of B movies and serials. The producers and their production team simply treated each episode as if were a mini (25 minute) B movie.'
 ""The producers never expected the audience to be able to see more than one episode per week. That is why some actors, such as 'Tristram Coffin' (qv), appeared is successive episodes playing different characters.""
 ""When the series was picked up by Kellogg's, the breakfast cereal manufacturer, some of the cast members were able to make extra money by appearing in Kellogg's commercials. This did not include 'Phyllis Coates' (qv) or 'Noel Neill' (qv). It was felt that Lois Lane having breakfast with Clark Kent was too suggestive.""
 'An often talked-about mistake in the show is that Superman would duck when a thug would throw his empty gun at him. While this mistake is often attributed to \'George Reeves (I)\' (qv) not wanting to be hit by a prop gun, it was actually George\'s stunt double \'Dale Van Sickel\' (qv) who ducked. This mistake actually only happened once, in _""Adventures of Superman"" (1952) {The Mind Machine (#1.8)}_ (qv)). If you watch the fight scene closely, you can see that a stunt double is used some of the time and that it is that double who ducked. The fan group for the Adventures of Superman (The Adventures Continue) has published more details about Van Sickle making this mistake.'
 ""The Superman costume was padded to make it appear that 'George Reeves (I)' (qv) had greater bulk. However, Reeves himself did most of the stunts, which required impressive athletic ability including jumping from substantial heights (to simulate Superman landing in the frame), hitting a springboard with sufficient force to propel him out of frame (to simulate Superman taking off in flight), swinging through windows, and hours spent doing wire work and being in a body support platform to create the scenes of Superman flying.""
 ""In the early seasons, wire work was used to create some of the flying scenes. During the course of this work there had been some minor mishaps, but on one occasion the support wires snapped, causing 'George Reeves (I)' (qv) to be dropped to the floor. Reeves refused to do anymore wire work. This is why episodes in the early seasons would show Superman taking off in flight within the frame. But, in later seasons, he would run toward the camera, hit a springboard hidden below frame and leap out of frame.""
 'The train seen in the opening sequence for the first two seasons is a streamline steam locomotive. Starting with the third season, which was filmed in color, a modern diesel locomotive was seen instead.'
 ""In the first season, when 'Phyllis Coates' (qv) played Lois Lane, she got star billing along with 'George Reeves (I)' (qv). When 'Noel Neill' (qv) took over the role in the second season, her character was reduced to featured billing.""
 'For the first season of the series, the E. Clem Wilson Building in Los Angeles was used for the exterior shots of the Daily Planet. Throughout the rest of the series, the building seen as the Daily Planet Building is really Los Angeles City Hall. The rest of the buildings that stand in for ""Metropolis"" in street scenes were back-lot facades at the old RKO Forty Acres lot in Culver City, which earlier had been Atlanta for _Gone with the Wind (1939)_ (qv), and would later serve as Mayberry for _""The Andy Griffith Show"" (1960)_ (qv).'
 ""'Bill Kennedy (I)' (qv) received $350 for performing the opening narration used in all episodes, but did not receive any residuals for his work.""
 'The series was honored on its 50th anniversary when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors proclaimed July 10-16, 2001, as ""Superman Week."" A proclamation was presented to Paul Levitz of DC Comics in a ceremony that was also attended by \'Jack Larson (I)\' (qv), \'Noel Neill\' (qv), Mrs. Robert Shayne, Mrs. Jerome Siegel, \'Robert Rockwell (I)\' (qv), \'Jeff Corey\' (qv) and Walter Walbrecht, vice president of Warner Brothers. Season 3, Number 4 was named ""Superman Week"" honoring the Man of Steel and was first broadcast on 14 May 1955.'
 ""'John Hamilton (I)' (qv), who played Perry White, had trouble remembering his lines. The solution was to film him sitting at his desk, with the desk littered with papers--including the script--so he could glance down to be prompted for his next line.""
 '\'Phyllis Coates\' (qv)\' last official appearance as Lois Lane was in the first season episode #24, _""Adventures of Superman"" (1952) {Crime Wave (#1.24)}_ (qv)). The two episodes that followed this one were the two-part edited version of _Superman and the Mole-Men (1951)_ (qv) (renamed ""The Unknown People""). \'Noel Neill\' (qv) assumed the role in the first episode of Season 2, _""Adventures of Superman"" (1952) {Five Minutes to Doom (#2.1)}_ (qv)).'
 'The phone number of the Daily Planet (and to Superman) was Metropolis 6-0500 (636-0500).'
 '\'George Reeves (I)\' (qv) wanted to quit the series after the third season. \'Kirk Alyn\' (qv), who played Superman in the 1940\'s film serials, was offered the chance to replace Reeves but turned it down. Reeves tried to produce his own series titled ""Port of Entry"". But when he was not able to secure financing, he returned to Superman with an increase in salary.'
 ""After 'George Reeves (I)' (qv)' death, producers considered continuing the series with Jimmy Olsen becoming the main character and including stock footage of Reeves as Superman. 'Jack Larson (I)' (qv), however, rejected the idea.""
 ""'John Hamilton (I)' (qv) died after the sixth season. For the planned seventh season, 'Pierre Watkin' (qv), who played Perry White in _Atom Man vs. Superman (1950)_ (qv), was going to replace Hamilton, but Reeves died before the seventh season was to be produced.""
 ""'George Reeves (I)' (qv) was 38 years old when the series began, making him the oldest actor to have ever played Clark Kent / Superman in live action.""
 ""'George Reeves (I)' (qv) (Clark Kent / Superman) was the only actor to appear in all 104 episodes of the series.""
 ""In the earlier episodes, Jimmy Olsen ('Jack Larson (I)' (qv)) wore thicker curly hair, In the later episodes he wore a crewcut.""
 'In every episode of the first season, Superman smiles whenever someone shoots at him ineffectively.'
 'In every episode of ""The Adventures of Superman"" where Superman enters Perry White\'s office through the window (presumably after first landing on an undisclosed ledge or small balcony), Superman sidles in between the windows\' large tilted louvres. There is never any suggestion that he must first open a window or sliding glass door to come through the window.'
 'Perry White (John Hamilton) often referred to Jimmy (Jack Larsen) as ""Young Olsen"".'
 ""In the years following the show's ending, Phyllis Coates, Noel Neill and Jack Larson all made cameo appearances in other Superman live action TV or movie adaptations.""
 ""Contrary to some belief, John Hamilton is not related to Neil Hamilton, who played Commissioner Gordon on the 1960's Batman TV series. In the comics, Perry White and Commissioner Gordon were at times seen as counterparts in the respective Superman and Batman Families of supporting characters.""
 ""With the death of 'Noel Neill' (qv) (Lois Lane) on July 3, 2016, 'Phyllis Coates' (qv) (Lois Lane) is the last surviving regular cast member of the series.""
 ""With the deaths of Johh Hamilton (Perry White) and series star, George Reeves (Clark Kent/Superman) in 1958 and 1959 respectively, the producers planned to cast Kirk Allyn as Kent/Superman and Pierre Watkin as Editor White' as they had originated the roles in the two Columbia Pictures serials. But instead the series was canceled.""

Andy usually began each program with Andy's Story Time. Seated on stage in a large easy chair, he opened a rather big book called Andy's Stories. As he read a chapter, a filmed segment was shown. Most often, Andy's stories related the thrilling, serialized adventures of ""Gunga, the Elephant Boy"" (originally Ghanga Rama on ""Smilin Ed's Gang""). These tales, set in Bakore, India, followed the exploits of Gunga and his friend Rama as they performed hazardous assignments for the Maharajah. Segments about either Grandie the Talking Piano or Midnight the Cat and Squeaky the Mouse followed. The talented cat and mouse performed like a vaudeville team (for example, while Squeaky played his ukulele, Midnight would dance on her hind legs). Finally came the most popular segment. Andy, standing next to a grandfather clock, would say, ""North or south, east or west, wherever you are, Froggie the Gremlin, we want you to become visible. Plunk your magic twanger, Froggie."" A puff of smoke and the magical and mischievous Froggie the Gremlin (a rubber frog toy) would appear. After a brief chat with Andy, the show's weekly guest arrived and Froggie would do his best to annoy him (for instance, guest Alan Reed would say, ""Greetings and salutations, everyone, it is I, Algernon Archibald Percival Shortfellow the poet."" Froggie would immediately interrupt: ""He's crazy, he is, he is."" The poet would respond, ""Yes, I'm crazy I am, I am. No, no, no...."" Total chaos followed as the poet tried to recite his poems.) With the conclusion of Froggie's segment also came the end of our Saturday half-hour stay at Andy's clubhouse. Andy appeared one last time to say, ""Yes, sir, we're pals and pals stick together.

 Bachelor Father. ,Series, Comedy," CBS, NBC, ABC"," Bentley Gregg is a sophisticated, single, private practice attorney with an office in the Crescent Building in Los Angeles. He lives at 1163 Rexford Drive in Beverly Hills with hisniece Kelly, a pretty 13-year-old girl who became his responsibility after her parents (Bentley's sister and brother-in-law) were killed in a car accident. Also living with them is Peter Tong, Bentley's Chinese houseboy and Jasper, the family dog. Bentley is a graduate of Harvard Law School. He is a smooth and brilliant conversationalist and girls swoon as he always manages to say the right thing. His greatest challenge is remaining single (he is just not yet ready to settle down) especially when his married friends (who sometimes set him up with dates) think he should become one of them. Kelly is a very sweet and very obedient young lady. Bentley treats her like she was his own daughter and Kelly never takes advantage of the situation (she not only has the greatest respect for him, but she admires him). Kelly and her friends Ginger and Howard attend Beverly Hills High School and hang out at Bill's Malt Shop after school. Howard was Kelly's on-and-off boyfriend from  1957-1961. When the series switched to ABC, Kelly who had become a beautiful young lady, needed a more sophisticated boyfriend (Howard was immature and lacked Bentley's polish and finesse). Warren Dawson, Bentley's law partner, became her new love interest. Ginger lives next door to Kelly and had three last names: Farrell (1957-1958; Louise was her widowed mother); Loomis (1958-1961; Bert and Amy were her parents); and Mitchell (1961-1962; Cal and Adelaide were her parents). Bentley also had four secretaries: Vickie, Kitty Devereaux, Kitty Marsh and Connie. Peter calls Bentley ""Mr. Gregg"" and Kelly ""Niece Kelly."" He attends night school to improve his knowledge of America and he mutters in Chinese when he gets upset. He has many relatives and two of them. Grandpa Ling and Cousin Charlie, appear often. Peter calls Grandpa ""a 70-year-old juvenile delinquent."" Charlie is the schemer of the family and always looking for an easy way to make money. Chuck Forrest and Frank Curtis are Bentley's friends; Elaine is Howard's sister; Gloria and Lila are Kelly's friends; Horace and Myrtle are Warren's parents. See also New Girl in His Life for information on the series pilot film.

 '""Beat the Clock"" was one of televisions most durable game shows. Its popularity was derived from its simple format and wacky action. Two couples, preselected from the studio audience, had to complete various stunts within a time limit (usually 60 seconds or less) to win cash and prizes. Examples of the often-messy stunts (the centerpiece of the show) included blowing a plastic ship carrying a ping-pong ball from one side of a water-filled tub to the other, without allowing the ball to fall off; stuffing eight balloons in a lidded wastebasket without breaking any; and extracting three marshmallows buried in Jell-O using a spoon held in his mouth, then placing each marshmallow on a plate next to them. A huge clock counted down the seconds, as host Collyer provided commentary and encouragement. Couples who successfully completed their stunt won cash (usually $100 to $200, depending on the round) and a prize. After the first round of stunts, each couple got a chance to complete an extra-difficult ""bonus stunt"" (e.g., blowing a feather off a table and then catching it with a top hat while it was being worn) worth $100 plus $100 for each show it was not completed. During the big-money quiz-show era, the bonus prize stunt was worth $5,000 plus $1,000 for each show not completed. The format of ""Beat the Clock"" factored into countless stunt-related game shows in the years that followed; two ""Beat the Clock"" revivals also followed one in 1969 and another in 1979, both enlisting the aid of celebrity guests.']","[""'James Dean (I)' (qv), whose first TV appearances were in Goodson-Todman-produced anthology dramas, was also employed by G-T as a stunt tester for this program.

 Blondie. ,Series, Comedy, NBC," Blondie Davenport and Dagwood Bumstead met on a blind date. Although they were with different people, Dagwood could see that Blondie didn't care for the fellow she was with. The following night, Dagwood brought Blondie flowers and candy; before long they fell in love and decided to marry. They eloped to a town called Sherman Grove and were married by a justice of the peace. (Dagwood has since lost their marriage license. He accidentally grabbed his marriage license when he went on a hunting trip and lost it _æ but he bagged three ducks.) In the comics, Blondie was a Depressionera gold digger seeking a rich husband _æ Dagwood. Years later Blondie has a home (house number  4224), two kids (Alexander, nicknamed ""Baby Dumpling,"" and Cookie), six dogs (Daisy, a ""purebred mongrel,"" and her ""five children""), and a bumbling husband who works as an architect for the J.C. Dithers Construction Company. ""We all adore you Dagwood, even if you are dumb at times,"" says Blondie. Dagwood is a natural humbler and becomes a nervous wreck when it comes to his boss, J.C. Dithers. When J.C. says, ""Emergency,"" Dagwood answers like a faithful Saint Bernard: he drops whatever he is doing to rush to the office. (Dagwood is ""sort of a vice president _æ it comes and goes."" When he blunders, it goes; when his blundering turns out for the best, he's a v.p. again). On Dagwood's birthday, Blondie gets him something she needs for the house or something the kids want (over the years, Dagwood has gotten a sewing machine, a washing machine, a doll house and a baseball bat and glove). Dagwood and J.C. are members of the Loyal Order of Caribou Lodge; J.C. has an antique gun collection that his wife feels is just a waste of money (he buys his guns at Miller's Sport Shop). Dagwood is famous for his yell _æ ""B1-o-o-o-n-d-i-e-e-e"" _æ when something goes wrong.The series is based on tlie comic strip by Chic Young, and most people readily think of Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake, the stars of the 1930s and  1940s motion picture and radio series, as Blondie and Dagwood.

 Bonanza. ,Series, Western, NBC," The saga of the Cartwrights (Ben, a widower, and his sons Adam, Hoss and Little Joe) who own the Ponderosa Ranch during the 1880s. Ben Cartwright was a former first mate who ran a chandler's store in New England. He was marriedto Elizabeth Stoddard, the daughter of his former captain. A year later, a son they name Adam was born to them, but complications from the birth cost Elizabeth her life. Ben possessed a dream of settling in California. Motivated by Elizabeth's desire for him to pursue that dream, Ben sold his business and headed west. Ben and Adam settled temporarily in St. Joseph, Missouri. Adam (Johnny Stephens) is five years old, and Ben has fallen in love with a Swedish girl named Inger Borgstrom. Inger runs the general store (Ben met her when he went to buy food), and she helped Adam over a crisis _æ breaking his high fever. Ben and Inger marry. Ben is persuaded by Inger to continue his journey west. He organizes a wagon train and takes on the responsibility of bringing settlers to California. During the hazardous trek through Nevada, Inger gives birth to a son they name Eric Hoss. Shortly after, during an Indian attack, Inger is killed. Ben abandons his dream forever and settles in Virginia City, Nevada, where he establishes the Ponderosa Ranch. The birth of Ben's third son, Joseph Francis (""Little Joe"") evolves from a complex story in which Ben journeys to New Orleans to personally fulfill the last request of a ranch hand who died saving Ben's life. Love develops as a result of Ben's meeting with Marie DeMarne, the widow of the ranch hand. A marriage ultimately results, and Marie returns to Virginia City with Ben. Shortly after the birth of their son, Marie is thrown by her horse and killed. The Ponderosa Ranch is a 1,000-square mile timberland ranch in the Comstock lode country (it is located on the outskirts of Virginia City). Eric's middle name, Hoss, is a Swedish mountain name for a big, friendly man _æ something Inger knew the boy would be even though she only lived long enough to see him as an infant. Adam is considered ""best at judging horse flesh; better than anyone in the whole territory."" Ben's horse is named Buck; Hoss's is named Chuck; and Little Joe's is named Cochise. See also Ponderosa.

 ""The Cartwright's one-thousand square mile Ponderosa Ranch is located near Virginia City, Nevada, site of the Comstock Silver Lode, during and after the Civil War. Each of the sons was born to a different wife of Ben's; none of the mothers is still alive. Adventures are typical western ones, with lots of personal relationships/problems thrown in as well.""]","[""In the show's early episodes the writers would typically have the Cartwrights being hostile to visitors to their property. 'Lorne Greene' (qv) objected to this, pointing out that with the Ponderosa being as large as it is, the Cartwrights would be an important business interest in the community. Thus visitors would naturally come for economic and political reasons as well as social ones and the Cartwrights would logically welcome them as such. The producers agreed and altered the premise of the characters accordingly.""
 ""During the first season of the show the guest stars were paid far more than the stars of the show, because the producers didn't think that the stars were well-known enough to pull in viewers.""
 ""When 'Dan Blocker' (qv) died unexpectedly shortly before filming began for the final season, it was decided to have Hoss die, too, by having him killed in an accident. The opening episode, a two-hour special in which Little Joe marries only to see his bride die, was originally scripted to feature Hoss.""
 '\'Anthony Lawrence (II)\' (qv) didn\'t write authentic Western scripts so he focused on writing about relationships and character (as he did in _""Bonanza"" (1959) {Dark Star (#1.31)}_ (qv) and _""Bonanza"" (1959) {The Last Viking (#2.10)}_ (qv), for example). One day, producer \'David Dortort\' (qv) told Lawrence he wanted to do a story on each of Ben\'s wives, and the screenwriter replied, ""Let me do it, I can kill off at least two of them!"" Lawrence thought he would get thrown off the set for saying this, and instead was given the task of becoming the writer who scripted the stories with Ben and his wives, all three of whom died (_""Bonanza"" (1959) {Elizabeth, My Love (#2.33)}_ (qv), _""Bonanza"" (1959) {Inger, My Love (#3.29)}_ (qv), _""Bonanza"" (1959) {Journey Remembered (#5.8)}_ (qv), and _""Bonanza"" (1959) {Marie, My Love (#4.20)}_ (qv)).'
 'The character ""Ben Cartwright"" was ranked #2 in TV Guide\'s list of the ""50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time"" (20 June 2004 issue).'
 'Although it got off to a rough start, by 1961 it was the #1 show on TV.'
 ""Most viewers have only heard the famous theme song by 'Jay Livingston' (qv) and 'Ray Evans (I)' (qv) played as an instrumental. The theme song actually had lyrics and there is footage of the lead actors singing those lyrics. 'Lorne Greene' (qv), 'Dan Blocker' (qv) and 'Michael Landon (I)' (qv) sang a lyric version of this famous instrumental theme for the pilot, but it never aired. 'Johnny Cash (I)' (qv) recorded his own version of the theme song.""
 'According to the 1973 book ""Marilyn Beck\'s Hollywood"", when \'Pernell Roberts\' (qv) told \'Lorne Greene\' (qv) he was leaving the series because he wanted to challenge himself as an actor, Greene told him to stick to it as he would be so rich by the end of the run he could hire \'Tennessee Williams\' (qv) himself to write a play for him. Roberts\' career went into a tailspin that lasted over a decade after he left the show. Co-star \'Michael Landon (I)\' (qv) later said of Roberts\' departure that they simply took a leaf out of the dining room table and split the money three rather than four ways. While the post-""Bonanza"" Roberts struggled (until later catching on with _""Trapper John, M.D."" (1979)_ (qv), Greene, Landon and \'Dan Blocker\' (qv) became very wealthy from their income from the show, which all three wisely invested in.'
 'This was the first US Western television show to have all its episodes filmed in color.'
 ""During the filming of one episode, 'Lorne Greene' (qv) was required to jump off a small ledge into a lake five feet below. 'Michael Landon (I)' (qv) later recalled that when Greene did the stunt, he jumped into the water feet first and went completely under, but his hair piece came off and floated on the surface of the lake. Landon and the rest of the crew watched to see what would happen. After a short while, Greene's hand shot up out of the water, grabbed the hairpiece, and pulled it down. Greene emerged from the lake, wearing his hairpiece slightly askew. He walked nonchalantly past the snickering crew, and went into his trailer without saying a word.""
 '_""Bonanza"" (1959) {Ride the Wind: Part 1 (#7.17)}_ (qv) and _""Bonanza"" (1959) {Ride the Wind: Part 2 (#7.18)}_ (qv) were released as a theatrical film outside the US. In Mexico it was called ""Jinetes del Viento"".'
 'The last 14 episodes of Season One and the first 17 episodes of Season Two have fallen into the public domain. These 31 episodes have been released by many different companies in many different configurations, usually with the familiar theme music replaced with generic music. Starting with episode 1.19, the 31 episodes in order are: ""The Gunmen"", ""The Fear Merchants"", ""The Spanish Grant"", ""Blood on the Land"", ""Desert Justice"", ""The Stranger"", ""Escape to Ponderosa"", ""The Avenger"", ""The Last Trophy"", ""San Francisco Holiday"" (aka ""San Francisco""), ""Bitter Water"", ""Feet of Clay"", ""Dark Star"", ""Death at Dawn"", ""Showdown"", ""The Mission"", ""Badge Without Honor"", ""The Mill"", ""The Hopefuls"", ""Denver McKee"", ""Day of Reckoning"", ""The Abduction"", ""Breed of Violence"", ""The Last Viking"", ""The Trail Gang"", ""The Savage"", ""Silent Thunder"", ""The Ape"", ""The Blood Line"", ""The Courtship"" and ""The Spitfire"".'

 ""For most of its 430-episode run the show's main sponsor was Chevrolet, The stars occasionally appeared in commercials endorsing Chevrolet automobiles.""
 ""The opening burning map of the Ponderosa Ranch was illustrated without compass points, which caused the map to appear to be incorrectly oriented (i.e., Reno appeared to be west of Carson City. 'David Dortort' (qv), choosing not to redo the map, added the compass points. Many have suggested that the compass points are pointing in the wrong direction (slightly north-northwest), but in reality the compass points are aligned with Magnetic North instead of True North.""
 'A recurring situation was that every time one of the Cartwrights became seriously involved with a woman, she died from a malady, was slain, or left with someone else.'
 'According to \'David Dortort\' (qv), \'Michael Landon (I)\' (qv) grew difficult during the last five seasons the show ran: ""Nearly every line, every scene, every set up . . . everything would halt for endless story conferences on the set . . . it got increasingly bitter toward the end.""'
 'From the third season on, the Cartwrights and nearly every other recurring character on the show wore the same clothing in almost every episode. This was done to cut the cost of re-filming action shots (such as riding clips in-between scenes), as previously-shot stock footage could be reused.'
 ""Saturday nights ratings were dismal and the show was soon targeted for cancellation. Given one last chance, it was moved to Sunday nights at 9:00 p.m. The new time slot caused the series to soar, and it eventually reached #1 by the mid-'60s.""
 ""In 1968 'Dan Blocker' (qv) began wearing a toupee on the series, as he was approaching 40 years of age and beginning to lose his hair. He joined the ranks of his fellow co-stars 'Pernell Roberts' (qv) and 'Lorne Greene' (qv), both of whom began the series with hairpieces (Greene wore his modest frontal piece in private life, too, whereas Roberts preferred not wearing his, even to rehearsals/blocking). 'Michael Landon (I)' (qv) was the only original cast member who was wig-free throughout the series, as even 'Victor Sen Yung' (qv)'s Hop Sing wore an attached queue (ponytail).""
 '\'Dan Blocker\' (qv) owned a chain of restaurants called ""Bonanza"". They were steakhouses similar to the ""Golden Corral"" chain. When the ownership later changed, all of the restaurants were later renamed ""Ponderosa"".'
 ""Both 'Robert Blake (I)' (qv) and 'Robert Fuller (I)' (qv) were considered for the role of Little Joe Cartwright, but lost to 'Michael Landon (I)' (qv). This was because producer 'David Dortort' (qv) had mixed feelings about the new, unfamiliar actor auditioning for the part, thinking Landon was way too young to play the role. With the encouragement of his wife, who picked up a publicity still of Landon, Dortort changed his mind and gave Landon the role.""
 'For a long time producer \'David Dortort\' (qv) refused to allow \'Michael Landon (I)\' (qv) to write scripts for the show. It took many failed attempts by Landon before he eventually submitted a script that Dortort thought good enough to make. After this he became a regular writer for the series and later would re-work many of his scripts for new episodes of _""Little House on the Prairie"" (1974)_ (qv).'
 'Several major actors from the original _""Star Trek"" (1966)_ (qv) series appeared as guest stars at one time or another on the show: \'William Shatner\' (qv), \'Leonard Nimoy\' (qv), \'DeForest Kelley\' (qv), \'James Doohan\' (qv), \'George Takei\' (qv), \'Nichelle Nichols\' (qv), \'Grace Lee Whitney\' (qv), \'Majel Barrett\' (qv) and \'Walter Koenig (I)\' (qv).'
 ""'Michael Landon (I)' (qv) wore four-inch lifts in the series.""
 'The brothers Adam, Hoss, and Joe were not full brothers, but half brothers. Same father, different mothers.'
 ""Before becoming a rancher, Ben Cartwright was a ship's Captain. His port of call was New Orleans .""
 ""Hoss' given name is Eric, his mother was Ben's second wife, Inger.""
 'Bonanza was not the first television western series to be completely shot in color as stated elsewhere. That honor goes to The Cisco Kid (1950 - 1956). Bonanza was the first ""network"" television western to air completely in color.'
 'After 11 seasons the show\'s theme music was replaced at the start of Season 12 by an original tune composed by David Rose. Rose would continue to work with Michael Landon after ""Bonanza"" ceased production by becoming the resident composer on Landon\'s two later series ""Little House on the Prairie"" and ""Highway to Heaven"".'
 'Pernell Roberts was not a popular member of the cast either with his co-stars or the crew. He continually complained about the show feeling it was poor quality and beneath him as an actor as well as ignoring co-star Michael Landon to whom he very rarely, if ever, spoke.'
 ""'Pernell Roberts' (qv) objected to the racist portrayal of minorities in the series.""
 ""'Lorne Greene' (qv) was only 13 years older than 'Pernell Roberts' (qv).""
 ""One piece of footage was used often, of the main street in Virginia City. You'll notice in the lower left a surrey with passengers, with a China Man and an Indian talking over a jug - in the lower right, 2 old prospectors with mules.""
 'In their Television Archives interview, Ray Evans and Jay Livingston said when Desi Arnaz asked them to write a theme song for a Western television show, he told them he could not pay them much for a weekly salary, because the show was only going to last one year. The men made a deal with Desi to keep the rights to the song. When Bonanza became an unexpected smash-hit, owning the rights to the song, the men made millions.'

" Brave Eagle, Chief of the Cheyenne. ",Series, Western, CBS," The Black Mountain region of Wyoming (1860s) is the sacred land of the Cheyenne Indians.

Brave Eagle accepts all men as his brothers and has made peace with the white man (specifically, the men of the U.S. Cavalry, who have established Fort Wilson near the reservation). The Peagan tribe are the enemies of the Cheyenne, and the most sacred law of the Cheyenne is the law of hospitality (to offerfood and care to their fellow braves). Despite the fact that renegade Indians and ""bad guys"" use guns, Brave Eagle refuses to use such weapons (he and his tribe use the traditional bow and arrow). Keena is Brave Eagle's adopted son. (Brave Eagle found Keena, a member of the Lota tribe, as a papoose. Keena was the only survivor of a small band of Lota that was attacked by the Comanche. Brave Eagle took Keena to be his son.) Keena and Brave Eagle hunt on each full moon, and Keena has a pony he calls My Pony. Morning Star and Smokey Joe are the other featured members of the tribe.

 'In the annals of televison, few children\'s programs ever made as much impact as Captain Kangaroo. Hosted by Bob Keeshan (at one time, he played Howdy Doody\'s friend, Clarabell) from the appropriately-named Captain\'s Place, the Captain was so named because he always wore an overcoat with large, kangaroo-like pouches. Each show featured stories, skits, vaudeville acts, songs, games and other educational activities. Captain Kangaroo\'s friends were Mr. Green Jeans (who always brought an animal to the show); Dennis, an apprentice handyman and do-it-all person; and Mr. Moose and Bunny Rabbit. Bunny was always mute, but made his point ever-so-cleverly, while Mr. Moose always tricked the Captain into allowing him to stand under a shower of pingpong balls. As the show got on in years, new features were added, including Uncle Backwards (a tape of some simple action, such as peeling an orange or building a doghouse, shown in reverse); ""Picture Pages,"" a matching activity hosted by Bill Cosby; and Slim Goodbody, which taught children about health, nutrition and physical fitness. Many actors, actresses and singers guest starred. In the early 1980s, new formats were attempted, all without success including the early morning ""Wake Up with the Captain"" (which starred new puppet friends and employed the joke-of-the-day); by 1984, the show ended its 29-year CBS run. During the early 1990s, Bob Keeshan hosted a daily series airing on PBS; it featured clips from the classic program along with new footage.']","['This was America\'s longest-running children\'s television series until 1999, when _""Sesame Street"" (1969)_ (qv) surpassed it.

Captain Midnight's destiny began one night in a bomb shelter in France during World War II. The war has reached a moment of crisis and the Allies are in danger of a devastating defeat. Suddenly a man, whose name the general in charge does not want to know, enters the room. The man. Captain Jim Albright, is told ""that only two people in the world know the mission to which you have been assigned, myself and the President of the United States. The odds are 100 to 1 against you. If you fail tonight, it will be the end for all of us. If you succeed tonight, you will have started a long and dangerous task that may require a lifetime to complete "" (protect the world from evil). Albright's assignment is to exterminate Ivan Shark, the most dangerous criminal in the world (a traitor who has cost the lives of many Americans). As Albright is about to leave, the general tells him, ""Henceforth, until you complete your final task, you will not be known by your true name. What name you will be known by rests in the hands of fate."" ""Sir,"" the captain says, ""If I have not returned by twelve o'clock you will know that I have failed."" The hours pass slowly.

 Captain Video and His Video Rangers. ,Series, Science Fiction, DuMont," On June 27, 1949, a daily series called Captain Video premiered in New York City on the DuMont network's flagship station, WABD-TV, channel 5. It was simply a showcase for old western theatrical films with Captain Video serving as the host. As the network began to grow, the format was changed to focus on a crime fighter known as ""The Guardian of the Safety of the World."" The Captain was given an assistant, the Video Ranger and the program opened with these words over Wagner's ""Flying Dutchman Overture"": ""Master of Space! Hero of Science! Captain of the Video Rangers! Operating from his secret mountain headquarters on the planet Earth, Captain Video rallies men of goodwill everywhere. As he rockets from planet to planet, let us follow the champion of truth, justice and freedom throughout the universe. Stand by for Captain Video and His Video Rangers."" Only a handful of Captain Video episodes appear to exist; press release information is very scarce; and the pre-national TV Guide, TV Forecast, is extremely sketchy. It is difficult to determine when in 1949 the new Captain Video format emerged and when the words ""and His Video Rangers"" were added to the title. At this time, and until 1951, Jack Orsen played the Captain's superior, Commissioner Bell. In 1951 (and until 1957) Al Hodge took over the role of Captain Video (from Richard Coogan); Ben Lackland became Commission Carey, the Captain's new superior, from 1951 until 1955. The evil Dr. Pauli also became a regular at this time. Hoping to cash in on the show's popularity, DuMont added a Saturday morning version of the series called The Secret Files of Captain Video (9/5/53-5/29/54). Although that original DuMont station is still broadcasting in New York (now WNYW) it has no records of its time as a DuMont station. The TV ForecastYisim^s were mostly generic, listing only the series title; if program information was given, it was the star or a statement (for example, ""Scientific adventures in the world of the future""). TV Guide lists program notes for a number of Secret File episodes, although many state ""No program information available at press time."" It is possible, however, to determine that the Saturday shows were complete in one episode, not serialized adventures characteristic of the daily series. On March 28, 1955, the daily series came to an end. On July 10, 1955, the format changed again; it was now an hour-long series wherein Captain Video was the host to old theatrical serials and movies. On September 25, 1955, Captain Video was incorporated into Wonder Time, a six-hour series that ran from noon to 6:00 P.M.

 Captain Video and His Video Rangers. ,Series, Science Fiction, DuMont," On June 27, 1949, a daily series called Captain Video premiered in New York City on the DuMont network's flagship station, WABD-TV, channel 5. It was simply a showcase for old western theatrical films with Captain Video serving as the host. As the network began to grow, the format was changed to focus on a crime fighter known as ""The Guardian of the Safety of the World."" The Captain was given an assistant, the Video Ranger and the program opened with these words over Wagner's ""Flying Dutchman Overture"": ""Master of Space! Hero of Science! Captain of the Video Rangers! Operating from his secret mountain headquarters on the planet Earth, Captain Video rallies men of goodwill everywhere. As he rockets from planet to planet, let us follow the champion of truth, justice and freedom throughout the universe. Stand by for Captain Video and His Video Rangers."" Only a handful of Captain Video episodes appear to exist; press release information is very scarce; and the pre-national TV Guide, TV Forecast, is extremely sketchy. It is difficult to determine when in 1949 the new Captain Video format emerged and when the words ""and His Video Rangers"" were added to the title. At this time, and until 1951, Jack Orsen played the Captain's superior, Commissioner Bell. In 1951 (and until 1957) Al Hodge took over the role of Captain Video (from Richard Coogan); Ben Lackland became Commission Carey, the Captain's new superior, from 1951 until 1955. The evil Dr. Pauli also became a regular at this time. Hoping to cash in on the show's popularity, DuMont added a Saturday morning version of the series called The Secret Files of Captain Video (9/5/53-5/29/54). Although that original DuMont station is still broadcasting in New York (now WNYW) it has no records of its time as a DuMont station. The TV ForecastYisim^s were mostly generic, listing only the series title; if program information was given, it was the star or a statement (for example, ""Scientific adventures in the world of the future""). TV Guide lists program notes for a number of Secret File episodes, although many state ""No program information available at press time."" It is possible, however, to determine that the Saturday shows were complete in one episode, not serialized adventures characteristic of the daily series. On March 28, 1955, the daily series came to an end. On July 10, 1955, the format changed again; it was now an hour-long series wherein Captain Video was the host to old theatrical serials and movies. On September 25, 1955, Captain Video was incorporated into Wonder Time, a six-hour series that ran from noon to 6:00 P.M. Sandy Becker served as the host and Al Hodge, as Captain Video, hosted a series of cartoons and documentaries. On August 16,  1957, Captain Video ended with the demise of the DuMont network. The series itself was set in the future (the 21st then  22nd centuries). Captain Video is a scientific genius who heads the Video Rangers, an organization that battles evil throughout the universe (only the best candidates at Video Ranger Training Academies are chosen to become Video Rangers).

 'Set in the 22nd century, there were 51+ serialized stories in all, totaling 1,537 episodes. The show was 30 minutes in length, but for the first few years approximately half of the program consisted of serialized excerpts from old B-Westerns. Thes segments were supposed to depict Video\'s ""agents"". Eventually - likely by Summer, 1952 - these clips were phased out in favor of full length Captain Video adventures. In mid-September, 1953, the program reverted to a 15 minutes running time. Until late in 1950 there was no Wednesday episode, but it was seen on Saturday. (NOTE: This statement is questionable.) By 1951, the series\' level of sophistication had become much more finely-honed. Scripts came from top science-fiction writers and consultants, and many Broadway stage actors were cast. At its peak, over 125 stations carried the series, including many non-DuMont affiliates. The first TV-to-Hollywood spin-off, a 15-chapter serial from Columbia Pictures (_Captain Video, Master of the Stratosphere (1951)_ (qv) with a different cast), came from this program in 1951, and a Saturday-morning TV series (_""The Secret Files of Captain Video"" (1953)_ (qv)) began in 1953. However, despite the program\'s immense popularity, the DuMont network\'s insurmountable problems caused it to cease operations by 1955. While other DuMont programs were continued on other networks, DuMont refused to sell ""Captain Video"" to NBC, and \'Al Hodge\' (qv) returned as the Captain to host a local cartoon/documentary film series over New York station WABD, the former DuMont flagship. DuMont\'s television archive was destroyed by a successor after it\'s collapse. The total number of stories is probably closer to 100, and the episodes may number higher than 1,537, but remaining information only accounts for 51 stories.'
 'This series inspired the first board game (The Captain Video Space Game, early 1950) to be based on a television program.'

 'During the Vietnam War, American soldiers who were taken as Prisoners of War by the North Vietnamese were often interrogated and asked whom the American military leaders were. Reportedly, several POWs would respond with ""Captain Video."" The North Vietnamese interrogators, being extremely gullible, accepted this answer. This allowed the POWs to escape possible torture and avoid giving the identities of the real military leaders.'

 'Arthur C. Clarke\'s short story ""Arms Race"" (written especially for his collection ""Tales from the White Hart"") is based on his experiences writing for the show.'

The mysterious Captain Z-Ro is the inventor of a time machine that enables him and his assistant. Jet (a young boy) to view the past via the machine's telescreens. When a decision is made to view the past (usually the Captain's way to prove to Jet that something he read about actually happened), the Captain programs the time machine's Lectric Chamber with the date and time. The Cycle Reactor ""cracksthe fourth dimension and ejects us back in time."" When the search has been completed, the special television screens allow the Captain and Jet to see an event from the past. If the Captain feels a figure from the past is in danger, he can go back to that period by standing in the Lectric Chamber. When Jet activates the Spector Wave Length, the Captain begins to dematerialize and disappears from view. Symmetrical impulses are then transmitted over time, and the Captain reappears in the programmed era. The Captain helps people in trouble with his Pararay Gun (which paralyzes a subject for 60 seconds). When he has accomplished his mission, he says, ""All right, Jet, take me back."" Jet then reverses the Symmetrical Impulses, and the Captain returns to the present. The Captain, a research explorer in space and time, has a rocket ship called ZX-99. The Video Plate aboard the ship is a round picture-like tube that allows the Captain to view outer space. The Gravity Generator regulates the gravity inside the ship. The ZX-99 travels at the rate of five miles per second, and when one of the team is about to embark on a mission, the Captain says, ""Spaceman's luck."" Micro also assists them.

" Brave Eagle, Chief of the Cheyenne. ",Series, Western, CBS," The Black Mountain region of Wyoming (1860s) is the sacred land of the Cheyenne Indians. ""We learn to count our wealth in the beauty around us and in the qualities of wisdom and courage that serve us in our way of life,"" says Brave Eagle, the chief of the Cheyenne tribe. Brave Eagle accepts all men as his brothers and has made peace with the white man (specifically, the men of the U.S. Cavalry, who have established Fort Wilson near the reservation). The Peagan tribe are the enemies of the Cheyenne, and the most sacred law of the Cheyenne is the law of hospitality (to offerfood and care to their fellow braves). Despite the fact that renegade Indians and ""bad guys"" use guns, Brave Eagle refuses to use such weapons (he and his tribe use the traditional bow and arrow). Keena is Brave Eagle's adopted son. (Brave Eagle found Keena, a member of the Lota tribe, as a papoose. Keena was the only survivor of a small band of Lota that was attacked by the Comanche. Brave Eagle took Keena to be his son.) Keena and Brave Eagle hunt on each full moon, and Keena has a pony he calls My Pony. Morning Star and Smokey Joe are the other featured members of the tribe. Morning Star is a fullblooded Cheyenne; Smokey Joe ""was born of the white man's blood"" and served with the U.S. Cavalry (he wears a jacket with his sergeant's stripes) before choosing to live with the people on his mother's side of the family. Brave Eagle: Chief of the Cheyenne is the official screen title; the series is commonly known by its TV Guide listing of Brave Eagle.

 Cheyenne. ,Series, Western, ABC," On the third day of the ninth moon of the Indian calendar (September 12; this calendar has 13 moons each year with 28 days in each month), a wagon train traveling through Wyoming territory is attacked by the Cheyenne Indians. Chief White Cloud (Richard Hale) spares the life of a baby boy and raises him as his son. The boy, whom White Cloud said ""was so quiet and solemn that he must have the brain of a wise grey fox,"" was given the name Grey Fox. At age 12, Grey Fox chose to go the way of the white man and took the name Cheyenne Bodie. He left his home, ""south, where the river winds at the foot of the hills,"" and set out on his own. A ranch hand, cavalry scout, army undercover agent, deputy, trail boss and wagon train guide were but a handful of the jobs held by Cheyenne Bodie as he drifted across the American frontier of the 1860s. Cheyenne is a strong, quiet man who fights for the rights of others. He is proud of his heritage and is dedicated to helping the army build up the land and establish a peace treaty with his blood brothers (he can read smoke signals and is trusted by the Indian chiefs). He carries a hunting knife on the left side of his holster (his gun is on the right side) and is looking for a place to settle down and call home (he hopes one day to buy a ranch and raise horses). In the episode ""Legacy of the Lost,"" Sloane and Sloane detective Dennis Carter (William Windom) convinces Cheyenne that he is John Abbott, the long lost son of wealthy rancher Lionel Abbott (Peter Whitney). Cheyenne now has a younger brother, James Abbott (Peter Breck), and a sister-in-law, Lorna ( Jolene Brand); he is also heir to the vast Abbott wealth. (Cheyenne discovers that James hired Carter to find someone who could be John Abbott and then kill him so James could become the sole heir. By coincidence, Lionel's wife and infant son were on the same wagon train as the infant Cheyenne. Lionel believed that his son was taken by the Cheyenne and would one day return to claim what is rightfully his.) Note: L.Q. Jones as Smitty, a government mapmaker, was Cheyenne's sidekick during the 1955-56 season when Cheyenne alternated with Kings Row and Casablanca on Warner Bros. Presents.

" Commando Cody, Sky Marshal of the Universe. ",Series, Adventure, NBC," A ghost town called Graphite is the secret headquarters of a U.S. government scientist known only as Commando Cody, and his associates, Joan Albright and Ted Richards. Ted is later transferred and replaced by Dick Preston. Commando Cody works for an undisclosed organization headed by Mr. Henderson. The government insists that Cody wear a black mask (like the Lone Ranger's) at all times to protect his true identity. Cody, the inventor of the Rocket Flying Suit, has come to be known as ""The Sky Marshal of the Universe"" for his tireless efforts of protecting the Earth from the evils of outer space. Cody, Joan, Ted (and Dick) communicate with each other via their identification patches, which contain miniature two-way radios and operate on a frequency assigned only to Commando Cody. Cody's Rocket Flying Suit (which he wears over his gray suit) has a silver helmet, a backpack with two rockets for power. Only 12 episodes were produced and very little is done to explain things. When the series began, Cody has perfected the Cosmic Dust Blanket to protect the Earth from a missile attack by Retik, an evil extraterrestrial who must conquer the Earth to use it as a staging platform for his conquest of other planets. The serial-like chapters chart Cody's efforts to stop the Ruler. Dr. Varney first assisted Retik; he was replaced in episode four by Baylor. How the Ruler came to Earth or how he acquired his aides is not shown. Hydrogen hurricanes, the Magno Force Ray, radioactive gas, the Magnetic Drag Ray and the Refraction Field Force were some of the obstacles Cody had to battle to stop Retik (whose home base was the Moon). The series is based on three Republic theatrical serials: King of the Rocket Men (1949), Radar Men from the Moon (1952) and Zombies of the Stratosphere(1952). In the first serial, Tris Coffin played Jeff King, the Director of Security for Science Associates, who invented the flying suit, and was known as Rocketman. In the second serial, the Rocketman character became Commando Cody (George Wallace). The final theatrical entry starred Judd Holdren as Larry Martin, alias Commando Cody, and Aline Towne as his associate, Joan Albright (both of whom appeared on the TV series; Holdren, however, did not wear a mask here). Commando Cody was not a super hero. He was depicted as having no special powers in movies and on TV; the only weapon he carried was a gun. Cast: Judd Holdren [Commando Cody), Aline Towne {Joan Albright), William Schallert (Ted Richards), Richard Crane {Dick Preston), Greg Grey {Retik), Richard Crane {Retik; later), Peter Brocco {Dr. Varney), Craig Kelly {Mr. Henderson), Lyle Talbot {Baylor), Mauritz Hugo {Narkos), ]owne Jordan {Queen of the Mercurians) , Gloria Pall {Retik's Assistant).

This is because it was originally filmed as a TV series which contractual obligations forced Republic Pictures to give a theatrical release before allowing it to be broadcast on TV. As the episodes do not end in ""cliffhangers"", some serial ""purists"", considering this a requirement for the classification of a movie serial, refuse to accept it into the serial canon. Unlike short subject series, though, the episodes are not self contained - they follow a definite story arc, and cannot be shown out of order and have the story remain comprehensible to the viewer. Odd claims that unspecified 1950s legislation prohibited release of any motion picture filmed after 1948 from subsequently being released to television - which, if true, would prove that this title had no theatrical history and therefore must be classed as a TV series only - are entirely unfounded. In reality, post-1948 films were being shown on early-to-mid 1950s TV, often while still being available for theatrical showings as well, on a regular basis. In fact, the mass syndication of product postwar product by Republic Pictures itself resulted in many theaters boycotting this distributor for carrying the practice to an excess dangerous to the survival of motion picture theaters. The records of the New York State Censorship Board at the New York State Archives, clearly show that all twelve episodes of this serial were submitted for approval and licensing for theatrical exhibition in that state in 1953.'
 'During the lengthy break between filming the first three and last nine episodes of this TV series, Republic shot another Rocket Man serial called _Zombies of the Stratosphere (1952)_ (qv).

 Concentration. ,Series, Game," NBC, Syn."," A large electronic board that contains thirty numbered, three-sided wedges is displayed on stage. One of two competing players chooses two numbers. The wedges rotate and reveal prizes. If they match, the edges rotate again and reveal two puzzle parts. The player then attempts to guess what the puzzle will show (slogan, name or place). If he is unable to solve the puzzle, he picks two more numbers. If two different prizes appear, the wedges revert to numbers and his opponent receives a chance to play.

 'Two contestants, one a returning champion, competed to solve a rebus concealed behind a 30-space board. Each contestant called out a pair of numbers on the board which contained the names of prizes, humorous joke prizes and WILD and action cards (the latter three explained later). No match passed control to the opponent, but a match gave whatever prize was printed on the card or allowed him to perform an action, revealed two pieces of the rebus (identifying a person, phrase, place, thing, etc.) and allowed him/her a chance to solve the rebus. WILD cards provided an automatic match, while TAKE cards allowed the contestant at that moment to snatch a prize his/her opponent might have in their possession. A FORFEIT card meant the player immediately had to give up one of the prizes he/she had in his possession. The joke prizes (things such as a banana peel, a button, etc.) actually served as insurance markers against opponents TAKE cards and the FORFEIT cards he/she might stumble upon. Only upon correctly solving the rebus does a player actually win what he/she claimed from the board; the loser forfeits all his gifts. Originally, there was no bonus game; later in the run came ""The Envelope and its Mysterious Contents"" (which hid cash amounts or a prize such as a car), and still later, ""The Cash Wheel"" which allowed a player to win up to $2,000 cash. Champions continued until either defeated or by winning 20 games; the top winners each season returned to play a ""Tournament of Champions."" During the original run of ""Concentration,"" the show reportedly gave away 512 cars, 397 boats, 1,287 domestic and foreign trips and cruises, 12 trips around the world, 857 fur coats and numerous diamonds not to mention all the travel trailers, airplanes, swimming pools, furniture and countless other items (one history on the show reported the total prize giveaway at $10 million).'

 'John Frankenheimer liked to say that ""Danger"" was the most aptly-named show on TV, and insisted that, by the time he began working on it as an assistant director, the network was mostly assigning segments to directors they wanted to fire. The idea was that the pressure of work would cause these directors either to come up with inferior work which would be used as an excuse for dismissal or else force them to resign. He also claimed he was sometimes bribed by these directors to do most of their work for them so that they would look good to their bosses. Eventually, or so he told many interviewers, one director became hysterical during the live broadcast and he, Frankenheimer, had to knock him out and take over the full handling of the show to prevent catastrophe. This led to his being promoted to full-time director at age 24.'

She is totally dedicated to her job and she does suffer for it not only in long hours and dangerous cases, but she is shot at and she does take beatings from thugs; seeing her with a bruise or disheveled clothing and hair is not unusual. The series is ""Presented as a tribute to the Bureau of Police Women, Police Department, City of New York"" as seen in the opening theme.

 'The live-action adaptation of the Hank Ketcham comic strip of the same name. Dennis Mitchell was a loveable young boy, dressed in overalls and carrying a slingshot in his pocket. Everywhere he went, Dennis\' wide-eyed curiosity, well-meaning attempts to help out, and his simply being a normal, red-blooded American boy growing up always seemed to lead to trouble. Usually on the receiving end was Dennis\' next-door neighbor, retired business machine salesman George Wilson. Dennis worshiped Mr. Wilson, but he usually displayed a less-than-cordial attitude around the young lad. Mr. Wilson\'s wife, Martha, adored Dennis and saw him as a surrogate grandson (since the Wilsons never had any children). Dennis\' long-suffering parents were Henry (an engineer) and Alice (a stay-at-home mother). Episodes revolved around Dennis\' adventures and the trouble that usually followed. Also involved in the fun were Dennis\' friends Tommy, Margaret, and Seymour. During the final year of the show, Mr. Wilson\'s brother, John, moved in after George and Martha left the neighborhood (due to the death of Joseph Kearns). The live-action ""Dennis the Menace"" ran for years in syndication; an animated series showed up in the 1980s.']","[""After 'Joseph Kearns (I)' (qv)'s unexpected death, during season three, the explanation was that 'George Wilson' had gone on a trip to Ohio, and his brother John ('Gale Gordon' (qv)) had come to take care of the house for him and visit his sister-in-law, Martha Wilson, while 'George Wilson' was away.""
 ""'Jeannie Russell' (qv) was personally picked by 'Jay North (I)' (qv) to play the character role of Margaret Wade.""
 'Rascal & character role of ""Dennis Mitchell"" was ranked at number 8 in TV Guide\'s list of ""TV\'s 10 Biggest Brats"" (27 March 2005 issue), 46 years after the series started.'
 'In the United Kingdom, the show\'s title was shortened to ""Dennis"" to avoid confusion with an existing British strip with the exact same title. This latter strip came to TV as _""Dennis the Menace"" (1996)_ (qv), (this sequel was created, 37 years after the weekly series of four seasons began).'
 ""In the opening credits, the animated Dennis Mitchell spins around so fast & like an animated tornado, the hat changes from a fedora to a beanie cap & concludes with a fireman's hat.""
 ""Dennis Mitchell character was modeled after Dennis Ketcham, son of animator, 'Hank Ketcham' (qv), the creator of the comic strip, with the same title. Despite the affable nature of the character, the real Dennis suffered a somewhat tragical life. When he was only twelve years old, Dennis lost his mother to a drug overdose while she was in the process of divorcing his father. Hank Ketcham then moved them to Switzerland but when Dennis had trouble adjusting to his new life & environment, then started getting into trouble in school, Hank shipped him off to a boarding school back in USA while he stayed behind in Switzerland with his new wife and family. Dennis managed to straighten his life out and even joined the military and fought in Vietnam. After he returned home, he suffered from PTSD and all the while being estranged from his father who, by then, had earned (and continue earning) a lot of money from the daily newspaper comic strips he drew based on his son.""
 'As explained by \'Gloria Henry\' (qv), in an interview for the first season DVD set, only the series debut, _""Dennis the Menace"" (1959) {Dennis Goes to the Movies (#1.1)}_ (qv), depicted Dennis Mitchell, as he intentionally got into mischief (by secretly sneaking out of the house at night and misleading the babysitter, wondering where he may be). For the rest of the series, any misadventures caused by Dennis were always the result of his earnestness, or despite Dennis\' good intentions, but never misbehavior.'
 ""Ironically, 'Jay North (I)' (qv), who played a rascal & a mischievous child character in the series, has served in recent years as a correctional officer and administrator working in particular with troubled youths within Florida's juvenile justice system.""
 'Throughout the four seasons, there are 146 total episodes. Season one has 32 episodes, while seasons two, three & four have 38, apiece. Season one was all on a Monday evening, while the last three seasons (2, 3 & 4) with 114 episodes, 38 apiece, were Sunday evenings. 32 + 114 = 146.'
 'SPOILER: In an E! True Hollywood Story interview, Jay North revealed that after the first season of the show he was no longer happy with the pressure of being a child protagonist, specially because during those years his aunt became very authoritarian and wanted to control him, with even some physical punishment; this sacrifice unknown to his mother, cast and crew back then, accentuated the effects of the posterior abandonment that Hollywood has given many times to grown up actors typecasted as former child actors. He grew up angry with those memories and it was much later in life that he managed to deal with it all, accepting the positive impact the show had in its fans and the satisfaction of the nice image he created, then finding new horizons for himself as a person.'

""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" has run longer, but that has not been a weekly show in more than forty years.'
 'Several of the longer installments were released as theatrical films overseas.'
 'NBC was loyal to the show throughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s, but by 1979, ratings were declining, and they demanded changes in the format. The studio updated the visual look of the show with a disco theme song and a fancier opening sequence. This convinced NBC to renew the show until 1981. But the ratings did not improve, and NBC cancelled it. CBS then picked it up and featured an even more elaborate opening sequence using then-state-of-the art computer graphics. Disney cancelled the show in 1983, due to the start of The Disney Channel. The show was revived in 1986 on ABC, then moved to NBC in 1988. It was cancelled in 1990 after thirty-six consecutive seasons on network television. In 1997, the show was revived by ABC as _""The Wonderful World of Disney"" (1995)_ (qv).'
 '\'Walt Disney\' (qv)\'s last opening comments aired in ""A Salute to Alaska"", in April 1967, five months after he had passed away.'
 'While declining ratings were a factor in the decision, the show ended primarily because the studio felt it would be competing with the then-new Disney Channel on cable television. Today the Disney Channel rarely shows old Disney films or programs as they used to in the 1980s and 1990s.'
 'Some of the segments produced for this series would be released as shorts in international markets.'
 'The Disney feature-length films were, at first, either edited down to one hour, or broadcast in two or more weekly installments, one hour per week. It was not until the mid 1970s, that Disney Studios finally broadcast one of their feature-length films complete in one evening, the way all other films were usually telecast on network television.'
 'The series was so popular, that in 1972, NBC renewed it through 1976. During this period, Disney was the only Hollywood studio that routinely made money on most of its feature films.'
 'All of the ABC episodes were filmed in color, even though they aired in black and white. In general, ABC did not broadcast in color until the mid 1960s. During the years on ABC, the show went by the title of ""Disneyland"", with one of four weekly sub titles, either ""Fantasyland"", ""Frontierland"", ""Adventureland"", or ""Tomorrowland"", depending on the category of that week\'s show. When the show moved to NBC, in 1961, the different sub titles were dropped. Additionally, many of the ABC episodes that re-aired on NBC were shown in color, and have been that way ever since, even those episodes aired on The Disney Channel, as well as those released in the theater (""The Adventures of Davy Crockett"") and on home video.'

The moderator presents a cryptic clue repre-senting a popular slogan, quotation or phrase, which is indicated by a line of dashes, one per letter, on a large board. Players, who are informed of the mystery expression, receive one free guess. If the phrase is not identified, each panelist suggests a letter of the alphabet. If an incorrect letter is posed, that player is disqualified from that round and forfeits five dollars to the sender (home viewer) of the phrase. The game continues for the remaining players and ends when one of them identifies the unknown subject.

 'Down You Go, derived from the children\'s game Hangman, was the originator of the ""guess-a-letter, guess-a-word, guess-a-phrase"" game hook also employed by Wheel of Fortune one year later and to this day. Down You Go took a somewhat high-brow approach to the concept by inviting the home audience to send in phrases displayed as blanks on a large board to challenge a panel of four ""literary"" celebrities. The host, Dr. Bergen Evans (a recognized linguistic expert from Northwestern University), asked each panel member in turn to guess a letter. If the letter did not appear in the phrase, Dr. Evans would intone ""down you go"" and that panelist could guess no more letters in that round. If the letter was in the phrase, it was hung in front of each appropriate blank. After each letter guess, the panel huddled and could offer to guess the phrase. When the last panelist went ""down"", the round ended and the home contestant won a cash award. If the panel guessed the phrase, the contestant settled for a copy of the Down You Go parlor game.']","['This was one of the few series to be aired over all four commercial networks.

Fatima cigarettes, best of all king size cigarettes, brings you Dragnet."" Following an introduction to the evening's story, the voice of Sergeant Joe Friday is heard: ""This is the city, Los Angeles, California. I work here. I carry a badge."" Sergeant Friday, Badge 714, is with the Homicide Division of the L.A.P.D., although he is also seen solving cases associated with robbery, car theft and missing persons. Joe lives at 4646 Cooper Street, Apartment 12, and has been working on the force for 11 years. He was a rookie in 1940. Friday is a no nonsense detective with virtually no sense of humor. He is all work and totally dedicated to solving crimes. He likes to take his time at crime scenes and study the evidence; ""I sometimes get a notebook full of notes and a crime lab full of evidence but nothing to tie them together. I've got the pieces; I've just got to put them together."" The series was first broadcast on radio (1949) then concurrently on radio (1951-1957) and TV (19511959). Jack Webb played the same role with Barton Yarborough also doing double duty as his first partner, Officer Ben Romero. Dragnet's actual TV pilot aired on December 16, 1951, as a segment of Chesterfield Sound OjfTime. On December 19, 1951, Barton Yarborough died of a heart attack. In subsequent weeks, the three episodes filmed with Yarborough aired. In the fourth episode, titled ""The Big Sorrow,"" it was mentioned that Officer Romero had died of a heart attack. It is also in this episode that Joe shows compassion. Joe was next teamed with Sergeant Ed Jacobs (Barney Phillips) then with Officer Frank Smith (Herb Ellis, Ben Alexander); these actors also played the same roles on the radio version. Joe mentioned that he was a rookie when he first met Ben. Early episodes feature Dorothy Abbott as Joe's fiancee, Ann Baker. Joe's case investigations are realistically portrayed and are followed from the crime to the conviction (the sentence the felon received). The programintroduced two terms into the general language: M.O. (Method of Operation) and R.I. (Records and Identification). ""My name is Friday _æ I'm a cop"" and ""Just the facts, ma'am"" became Joe's catchphrases. While Joe did not have a steady superior, different captains appear in various episodes. Headquarters was said to be at 1335 Georgia Street. Hal Gibney and George Fenneman were the announcers; Walter Schumann composed the theme ""Dragnet"" (also known as ""The Dragnet March"" and ""Danger Ahead"").

 Father Knows Best. ,Series, Comedy," CBS, NBC"," Jim and Margaret Anderson are a married couple that live at 607 South Maple Street in the town of Springfield. They are the parents of Betty, Bud and Kathy and stories relate the simple pleasure and trying times the family faces. Jim is the manager of the General Insurance Company (also given as the Cavalier Casualty Insurance Company). He is known for his ability to solve virtually any problem his family may encounter (he says, however, ""I'm just an ordinary guy who sells insurance""). At times, when Betty has a problem, he does ask for Margaret's help because ""You've had more experience being a high school girl than I have."" Betty is the eldest child and the most sensitive. She is very caring and involves herself in other people's problems (always with a good intention to help). She is the smartest of the children and attends Springfield High School. Jim calls her ""Princess"" and the Malt Shop is the after school hangout. James Anderson, Jr., nicknamed Bud, was born in 1941. He attended Springfield High School (later Springfield College with Betty). He is actively involved in various sports, seeks the easiest ways to make money and is somewhat mechanically inclined (he likes to see what makes things work) . Kathy, the youngest child, is called ""Kitten"" by Jim and ""Angel"" by Margaret. While she is an angel most of the time, Kathy, who rarely involves herself with Betty or Bud's lives, manages quite well to find mischief on her own or with her friends . Father Knows Best is based on the radio series of the same title (NBC, 1949-1954) that starred Robert Young (Jim Anderson), June Whitley and Jean VanderPyl (Margaret Anderson), Rhoda Williams (Betty), Ted Donaldson (Bud) and Norma Jean Nilsson and Helen Strong (Kathy).

 Flash Gordon. ,Series, Science Fiction, Syn.," The G.B.I. (Galactic Bureau of Investigation) is a 22nd century organization that protects the members of the United Planets from alien invaders. Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Neptune are mentioned members of the alliance, while planets such as Thor, Eben, Diana, Oden and Zerkes are its enemies. Eben is said to pose the biggest threat as it is closest to Earth and only negative gravity protects the Earth from Eben. Commander Paul Richards heads the G.B.I. Flash Gordon, the son of a famous scientist, is its chief operative. Dr.Alexis Zarkov is the agency's chief scientist (inventor of negative gravity) and Dale Arden is his assistant, a scientist almost as brilliant as he. While Dr. Zarkovand Dale always assist Flash on assignments. Dr. Zarkov is always the last one to know what is happening ""because my work at my mountain lab keeps me out of touch with what is going on."" Flash, who wears a T-shirt with a lightning bolt on the front, originally had a rocket ship called the Sky Flash. When it was destroyed in a battle, he had the Sky Flash II (Casey the parrot is its mascot). Although the series is based on the comic strip by Alex Raymond, it differs greatly from the 1936 theatrical serial Flash Gordon. As originally depicted in the film. Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) was the athletic son of Professor Gordon, a world renowned scientist. He had no special powers and belonged to no organization. Steve Holland (TV's Flash Gordon) was like Buster Crabbe, physically right for the role. Dale Arden (Jean Rogers) was beautiful and sexy; she was not a scientist and always in harm's way. Jean, as Dale, was incapable of defending herself and relied on Flash to save her. Irene Champlin (TV's Dale Arden) was not as pretty as Jean Rogers and immediately strikes one as being too old for the part. Irene had dark hair (not blonde like Jean) and differed in the fact that she could defend herself and would jump into harm's way to help someone (Flash and Dr. Zarkov often had to restrain her from getting herself killed). Unlike Jean Rogers, whose character meant dangerous rescue missions for Flash, Irene's Dale was a quick thinker and often saved the trio from perishing. Television's Dr. Zarkov (Joseph Nash) was thinner and younger than one would imagine for one who accomplished so much. In 1936, Dr. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) was somewhat older, a bit heavier and was said to have invented Earth's first rocket ship (which he. Flash and Dale used to travel to the planet Mongo to stop Ming the Merciless from destroying the Earth). The television series was filmed in West Berlin (on a rather cheap budget); Kurt Heuser composed the theme.

The broadcast was hosted by 'Bert Lahr' (qv), who played the Cowardly Lion in the film, by Justin Schiller, a thirteen-year-old Oz book collector, and by a very young 'Liza Minnelli' (qv), daughter of 'Judy Garland' (qv).""
 'Ford Star Jubilee was a live, ninety-minute, color spectacular, that aired once a month on Saturday nights at 9:00 p.m., on CBS for, basically, one season. Sponsored by the Ford Motor Company, the shows featured top of the line talent in front of, and behind, the camera. The shows were done live from CBS\' New York studio #72, located at Broadway and 81st street, or at the CBS Television City Color Studios stage 43 in Hollywood, California. The ""Ford Star Jubilee"" program-series was nominated for a 1956 EMMY for Best Variety Series. Noël Coward and Mary Martin were nominated in the performer EMMY category for ""Together with Music"". In spite of the talent, and cost involved, the specials did not receive high enough ratings to satisfy Ford and CBS, especially CBS, who had to pre-empt Gunsmoke (1955) every time it aired. The series did not have reruns during the 1956 summer, since the format was live and unrecorded (on videotape) except as a kinescope black and white film archive copy. The Ford Star Jubilee monthly specials shut down, until resuming two show specials in the fall of 1956. CBS pulled the plug. The last of the ""Ford Star Jubilee"" series show was the first television airing of the classic film The Wizard of Oz (1939), with Bert Lahr (age sixty-one, 1895-1967), an original cast member, Judy Garland\'s daughter Liza Minnelli (age ten, born March 12, 1946) as the program hosts with a child Oz book collector Justin Schiller. This marked the only time on television that an actor or actress, who played a leading role in the original film, as well as one of the children of an actor or actress, who starred in it, hosted this type of television series presentation. The ""Ford Star Jubilee"" television Special series format was cancelled by Bill Paley, the Ford Motor Company, and CBS. This type of special became the anthology series Playhouse 90 (1956).'
 'Between December 1954 through March 1955, William S. Paley, founder of Columbia Broadcasting System Radio and Television Network, negotiated to inaugurate a new CBS series, a spectacular color television live special program to counter National Broadcasting Company Color Television network\'s live ""Producers\' Showcase"" series. The new age of exploration dramatically transformed network television programming and viewing. NBC had inaugurated their live televised-color-program-series on October 18, 1954, a dramatic color broadcast production of Noël Coward\'s play ""Tonight at 8:30"" starring Ginger Rogers, electronically transmitted from NBC Television\'s New York City studio. Both the NBC and CBS networks scheduled their ninety-minute color specials once a month. During the early 1950s, not all of NBC\'s television product was broadcast in color, NBC becoming a full color network in the late 1950s. Noël Coward\'s New York agent, Joe Glaser, met with William ""Bill"" Paley during the winter and spring 1955. Paley was in early preparations and scheduling programs for the CBS anthology series ""Ford Star Jubilee"" monthly specials. Noël Coward was offered to star and direct three of these ninety-minute CBS Spectacular Specials. Noël Coward\'s managers Lance Hamilton and Charles Russell negotiated with Bill Paley and CBS-New York, to pay Noël\'s television production company four hundred fifty thousand dollars to produce the three specials. Noël\'s American television appearance was scheduled after Noël\'s Las Vegas Desert Inn (June 3 to July 4, 1955) cabaret concert appearance. Noël\'s first CBS commitment would coincide with the CBS inaugural new ""Ford Star Jubilee"" special live color television series. The premiere ""Ford Star Jubilee"" special featured first: (#1.#1) ""The Judy Garland Show"" broadcast in color Saturday night, September 24, from CBS\' Hollywood Television City - Studio 43, in California. The second: (#1.ep#2) ""Together with Music"" starring Noël Coward and Mary Martin was a color broadcast the next month on Saturday night, October 22, from CBS\' New York City - Studio 72, Broadway and 81st Street. Only one special was filmed in Hollywood with Bing Crosby. He would not perform live in front of a television audience. The musical adaptation of the stage play ""High Tor"" (March 10, 1956 - #1.ep#7) was filmed at Desilu Studios-Hollywood, broadcast as a series special. At its core, broadcast network quality entertainment is an essential part of the communications job to continue to produce the best content the networks possibly deliver at the end of every day. Television wise, it simply comes down to the best content.'
 'As producer on the ""Ford Star Jubilee"" specials, Richard Lewine\'s only involvement with the specials was as the Vice President of CBS Television Network, under William S. Paley from 1952-1961.'

 Gunsmoke. ,Series, Western, CBS," The Atcheson, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad services the area in and around Dodge City, Kansas, during the 1860s. Boot Hill is the graveyard; the Dodge House, the hotel; and the Long Branch Saloon, the local watering hole. There is also Ma Smalley's Boarding House and the Marshal's Office on Front Street. Matthew (""Matt"") Dillon occupies that office, a U.S. Marshal who earns SlOO a month. Matt is tough, honest and fair. He is fast on the draw but not always quick to use his guns. Kathleen ""Kitty"" Russell, an ambitious hard working beauty, appears to be all business. She had a hard life and struggled to succeed in a world where women were meant to be nothing more than wives.dress makers or saloon girls. She is the owner of the Long Branch Saloon and is fondly called Miss Kitty. Galen Adams, fondly called ""Doc"" is the town's lone physician. Doc is well educated and has opinions about everything. He can only be as helpful as the 1860s-1880s medical knowledge will allow. His prognosis is ""we'll have to wait and see."" He loves fishing and his specialty is catfish stew. Festus Haggen is Matt's Deputy (originally introduced as a Wolfer [hunts wolves that kill livestock]). Festus is from a backwoods family (the Mooncreek Haggens) and never learned to read (because ""When you read the readin' how do you know that the person who wrote the readin' wrote the readin' right?"") He may not be educated but he has what today would be called street smarts. He rides a mule named Ruth and the disagreements he and Doc have added a comical touch to the series. Chester Goode was Matt's original deputy (replaced by Festus). He brews ""a mean pot of coffee"" and walks with a limp. He called Matt ""Mr. Dillon."" Quint Asper, the town blacksmith is part Comanche Indian; he also helps Matt out when a need arises. Newly O'Brien is the gunsmith, who later found an interest in being a lawyer then a doctor; Sam is the Long Branch bartender; Thad Greenwood is Matt's friend, the son of a sheriff who works at the livery stable and assists Matt on occasion. Nathan Burke is the freight agent; Mr. Jones is the general store owner; Percy Crump is the undertaker; and Louie Pheeters is the town drunk. In the opening theme, when Matt faces his opponent in the famous showdown, the opponent fires first. John Wayne introduced the series at the beginning of the first episode. The series is also known as Marshal Dillon. Three TV movies also aired: Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge (CBS, 9/26/87), in which Matt faces an outlaw with a score to settle. Gunsmoke: The Last Apache (CBS, 3/18/90) finds Matt reunited with Mike Yardner (Michael Learned), who is now the owner of the Yardner Cattle Company in Arizona (Matt first met Mike in the series episode ""Matt's Love Story""). Matt also learns that he has a daughter named Beth (Amy Stock) from the affair he had with Mike 20 years ago (occurring but never shown in the series episode. Matt had amnesia and Mike never told him when he regained his memory). The story follows Matt's efforts to save Beth when she is kidnapped by renegade Indians. Gunsmoke: To the Last Man (CBS, 1/10/92) finds Matt and Beth involved in the notorious Arizona blood feud of the 1880s (it was revealed that Mike ""died"" from a high fever).

 'When the show first aired in the United Kingdom, it was known as ""Gun Law"". This meant that the opening title sequence had to be re-filmed. Comedy writer \'Dick Vosburgh\' (qv) was picked to double for \'James Arness (I)\' (qv), due his similar height and build.'
 '""Get the hell out of Dodge"" is a reference to Dodge City, Kansas, which was a favorite location for westerns in the early to mid 20th century. Most memorably, the phrase was made famous by the TV show ""Gunsmoke,"" in which villians were often commanded to ""get the hell out of Dodge."" The phrase took on its current meaning in the 1960s and 70s when teenagers began to use it in its current form.'
 'Festus always wore his hat slightly to the right, placing it on his right ear to cause his ear to stick out slighty, sort of a "" floppy ear"", look.'
 'Some have rumored that the role of Chester and his limp or stiff leg was created using a rock placed in his boot to help it seem more realistic.'
 ""Country songs have refrence to Dillion never putting his boots under Kitty's bed.""
 'Festus and Doc had a love hate relationship. Festus would refer to Doc as ""you ol\' schutter you"", and would often ask Doc to have a drink or share a last drink for the night, hoping the end result would be Doc paying for the drinks because Festus would always have a reason to not have enough money to buy them both one. Festus tried doing the same relationship with the ""sub"" doc for the six episodes filling in, while in real life Doc was recovering from a heart attack, but the bond between Festus and Doc was too strong to replace, even for the short amount of time Doc (Stone) was out.'
 'In Steven Spielberg\'s 1971 TV-movie ""Duel"", Dennis Weaver\'s character stops at a filling station.

 ""Dennis Weaver stated on his commentary about his time on Gunsmoke, that he seriously regretted giving Chester his limp. He hadn't realized how much work it would become to maintain in everything Chester did.""
 'During the last ten years of the series, James Arness was suffering from severe arthritis, which got so bad that all his scenes for each episode were shot on a single day, allowing Arness to rest and recuperate in between.'

 Have Gun æ Will Travel. ,Series, Western, CBS," ""Have Gun -Will Travel. Wire Paladin, San Francisco"" reads the calling card of a man known only as Paladin, a fast gun for hire who operates out of the Hotel Carlton in San Francisco. Paladin is a connoisseur of the arts. He has box seats at the opera house, enjoys fine food (he even has his own recipes) and has an eye for the ladies. He smokes expensive cigars (he carries a spare in his boot), collects chessmen (especially the knight) and is lucky at gambling. He also has one rule: never to go anyplace without his gun. Paladin, a right-handed gunman, carries a Colt .45 revolver (""The balance is excellent; the trigger responds to the pressure of one ounce. It was handcrafted to my specifications."" He rarely draws it, ""But when I do I aim to use it""). Paladin's work clothes are a black outfit with a chess knight (the Paladin) embossed on his black holster. He also wears a black hat and carries a small derringer under his gun belt. Paladin is a graduate of West Point, and his experiences with the Union army have given him a knowledge of war tactics that he uses to help people. He has a talent with a gun, a devotion to duty and relaxes in luxury at the hotel, genuinely enjoying life between assignments. (He reads the newspapers from various states and sometimes sends his calling card to people he thinks may need his help; his fee is $1,000). The theme from the unaired pilot version of Have Gun _æ Will Travel exchims, ""There are campfire legends that the plainsmen spin, telling of the man with the gun, of the man called Paladin."" Little is known about Paladin. His legend began when an unnamed ex-army officer lost a large sum of money to a wealthy land baron (William Conrad) in a poker game. To repay the debt, the army officer agreed to help the land baron by killing Smoke, an outlaw who has been plaguing him. In a duel to the death, the officer kills Smoke . The officer then adopts Smoke's black outfit and the symbol of the Paladin as his own. He calls himself Paladin and begins a policy of hiring out his guns and experience to those who are unable to protect themselves. (In this particular episode, ""Genesis,"" Richard Boone played three roles: the older and younger Paladin and Smoke.) Hey Boy and Hey Girl are Paladin's servants at the Hotel Carlton; Mr. McGunnis is its manager. W. Beal Wong played Hey Boy's uncle. Sing Wo, owner of Sing Wo's Chinese Laundry, in one episode.

 Highway Patrol. ,Series, Crime Drama, Syn.," ""Whenever the laws of any state are broken, a duly authorized organization swings into action. It may be called the State Police, State Troopers, Militia, the Rangers or the Highway Patrol. These are the stories of the men whose training, skill and courage have enforced and preserved our state laws."" Dramatizations based on the experiences of Highway Patrol officers in all 48 states (at the time of filming). Dan Matthews, a Highway Patrol Chief, is representative of such officers who serve to patrol and protect as members of the Highway Patrol. Cast: Broderick Crawford {Dan Matthews), William Boyett {Sergeant Williams). Narrator: Art Gilmore. Theme Song: ""Highway Patrol"" by Richard Llewellyn. ",1956,,[None 'Action' 'Crime' 'Drama'],[None],"['Although not given specific screen credit, the California Highway Patrol was pleased to give technical advice on the production, even as far as providing all the patrol vehicles used in the series, and uniforms, too (modified to remove all references to California).'
 'The 1955 Buick Century two-door sedan models used by the Highway Patrol were not made available for sale to the general public.'
 'The California Highway Patrol strongly supported the program in its first two seasons, and the production company was able to rent actual CHP squad cars. Generic ""Highway Patrol"" logos were placed over the real CHP emblems and studio license plates were taped over the genuine ""E"" (exempt) plates. The 1955 Buick Century two-door sedans seen were built especially for the CHP and were never offered for sale to the public. Two-door sedans were adequate because the real CHP rarely arrested anyone at that time, being involved more with accident investigations, enforcement and auto thefts. Major police powers were not invested in the CHP until 1964. The show\'s uniforms were copies of the khakis worn by the CHP including the state seal and the slogan ""Eureka"", except that the word ""California"" was removed. Authenticity was a major goal, and Dan Mathews\' call sign - 21-50 - was the actual unit number of then-CHP Commissioner Bernard Caldwell. In mid-1956 the CHP dropped its support of the program over differences in story lines and presentation, and refused to supply any more squad cars. The producers quickly acquired an incorrect Buick Super four-door hardtop to complete that season. Accurate squad replicas were ordered for the 1957 season, but the 1958-season cars differed from reality. The trailer hitches seen on the squad cars were for towing the film company\'s equipment trailers to shooting locations. Brand names of suspect vehicles were never scripted; they were always described as ""a green coupe"", ""a tan station wagon"" or ""a dark-blue sedan"".'
 'The series\' opening credits originally expressed appreciation to Bernard R. Caldwell (the head of the California Highway Patrol during the mid-1950s) for technical advice and assistance, much of which was provided on-site by CHP Officer Frank Runyon. After the initial seasons, Mr. Runyon continued to serve as a technical advisor but the CHP reduced its official support for the program. The opening expression of gratitude thus became more ""generic"". It read: ""This program is dedicated to the Highway Patrols throughout the nation and their contribution to the safeguarding of public welfare. We are deeply grateful for the technical advice and assistance which made the authentic production of this program possible.""'
 'The production company (ZIV Television Programs, Inc.) made a determined effort to avoid any perception that children or minors were being exploited. The official ZIV writer\'s guide for ""Highway Patrol"" specifically stated that juvenile delinquents were forbidden and that it had to be obvious that any delinquent was an adult. The guide also stated that the show did not do kidnapping stories unless the person kidnapped was obviously an adult.'
 'At the end of the show each week, \'Broderick Crawford (I)\' (qv) would make a safety announcement. One of his famous ones was ""Leave your blood at the Red Cross, not on the highway"". He always ended by saying ""This is Broderick Crawford saying see you next week"".'
 '\'Broderick Crawford (I)\' (qv) played himself _""CHiPs"" (1977) {Hustle (#1.9)}_ (qv), being pulled over for running a stop sign and explaining to Officer Jon Baker ""You know, I was making those Highway Patrol shows long before you were born"". (Baker responded with, ""Yeah, they don\'t make TV programs like that anymore."")'
 'Like \'Broderick Crawford (I)\' (qv) who appeared on _""CHiPs"" (1977)_ (qv) once, \'William Boyett\' (qv) also appeared on the program, appearing a total of three times. In _""CHiPs"" (1977) {The Great 5K Star Race and Boulder Wrap Party: Part 1 (#4.5)}_ (qv) and _""CHiPs"" (1977) {The Great 5K Star Race and Boulder Wrap Party: Part 2 (#4.6)}_ (qv) he played a CalTrans supervisor, and in _""CHiPs"" (1977) {Silent Partner (#5.19)}_ (qv), contrary to his normal police officer role he played a car thief. In between the two, he was best known for playing Sgt. MacDonald, appearing 129 times on _""Adam-12"" (1968)_ (qv).'
 'While it was generally thought the program depicted the California Highway Patrol due to the technical assistance from the CHP and locations filmed in California, on several occasions this was disproved. In _""Highway Patrol"" (1955) {Stolen Car Ring (#2.12)}_ (qv), Matthews says he is from California and just passing through. In _""Highway Patrol"" (1955) {Hitchhiker (#4.27)}_ (qv), the robber from New York that had left a 1,400 mile long trail of robberies tells his wife it is a long way to California. Since it was shown in _""Highway Patrol"" (1955) {Mexican Chase (#4.20)}_ (qv) and _""Highway Patrol"" (1955) {Illegal Entry (#4.28)}_ (qv) that the state bordered Mexico, this leaves as the only possibilities Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. These states can likewise be eliminated. New Mexico uses a state police agency, not a highway patrol. Arizona can be eliminated due to their highway patrol cars of that era being all-white. Texas can be eliminated due to highway patrol officers there not wearing the type of hats shown.'
 'The wall maps Crawford and crew used was actually a map of central Oregon, centered around Prineville and Bend.'
 'Dan Mathews also used the expression, ""21-50, bye,"" at end of transmissions on the radio. Also, he often had to turn his car around in a rapid u-turn to proceed to the scene of the incident. Last, his son had the original patrol car a few years back, and maybe still has it.'

 How to Marry a Millionaire. ,Series, Comedy, Syn.," Penthouse G on the  22nd floor of the Tower Apartment House on Park Avenue in New York City is home to Michele ""Mike"" McCall, Loco Jones and Greta Hanson, three beautiful girls seeking millionaire husbands. The girls have taken a pledge (""On my honor I promise to do my best to help one of us marry a millionaire. So help me. Fort Knox""). Mike, Loco and Greta were each renting a small apartment on Amsterdam Avenue before Mike convinced them to pool their resources (""You gotta spend money to make money"") and rent a swank penthouse (""We have something to sell _æ ourselves _æ and we have to surround ourselves in the best possible surroundings""). While each seeks to help the other find a millionaire, virtually every cent they make goes toward paying the rent. When Mike spots a potential prospect, she sees dollar signs (as does the viewer _æ when a moneybag is superimposed over the subject); her credo is ""Have money, will marry."" Mike, the schemer of the group, works as an analyst for the Wall Street firm of Hammersmith, Cavanaugh and Hammersmith. She believes that ""the only way for a girl to be smart is to be dumb."" Mike reads the financial section of the newspaper and uses Dunn and Bradstreet ioT her research material. She feels that ""one of these days we're gonna hit it big"" and knows that women have to put on airs _æ ""Men go for either the sophisticated Tallulah [Bankhead] type or the slinky Marilyn Monroe type."" Greta is a hostess on the TV game show Go for Broke, a takeoff of The $64,000 Question. She reads Who's Who in America (her research material) and the drama and TV section of the newspaper. Greta borrows Mike and Loco's nylons, doesn't make her bed and enjoys soaking in a bubble bath. She hopes that if there is a millionaire out there for her that ""he comes along before he has to whisper sweet nothings in my ear trumpet."" Loco (her given name) was born in North Platte, Nebraska, on February 25. She was voted ""The one most likely to go further with less than anyone"" atNorth Platte High School. She is a bit naive when it comes to current events but has acquired encyclopedic knowledge of comic strips by reading Super Comics magazine. Loco is nearsighted and needs to wear eyeglasses but feels men will not find her attractive if she does. The resulting chaos often costs the girls a prospective husband (""Loco has cost us more millionaires than the 1929 stock crash"" says Greta). Loco, a fashion model for the Travis (later Talbot) Modeling Agency, is called ""a fabulous blonde with an hourglass figure."" While always fashionably dressed. Loco worries about short skirts that show her legs. At the start of the second season it is learned that Greta married and moved to California (""Greta wanted to marry an oil man,"" said Mike, ""but she married a man who owns a gas station""). Mike and Loco acquire new roommate Gwen Kirby when she responds to their Journal News newspaper ad. Gwen, born in Illinois, was a girl scout and had been working on a small magazine before coming to New York. She now works as an editor for Manhattan Magazine and is almost a clone of Greta: Marilyn Monroe figure, lover of bubble baths and a borrower (of Mike and Loco's nylons). In the original, unaired 1957 pilot, Greta Lindquist (Lori Nelson), Loco Jones (Charlotte Austin) and Mike Page (Doe Avedon) are the women seeking millionaire husbands (they share a 13th floor Manhattan penthouse apartment). Loco is a brunette (not a blonde) in this version but just as vain about wearing her glasses. She mentions that her real name is Rita Marlene Gloria Claudette Jones and that Loco is her nickname. She is a model but no agency name is given. Greta, a blonde who majored in psychology at college, is hostess on the TV game show The Dunlap Quiz Show.

 'Herbert Philbrick was a young professional and pacifist in 1939 Boston. He joined an anti-war group and quickly found himself caught up in the secret world of underground communist activity. He agreed to spy on the Communists for the FBI, and spent the next 9 years of his life as a Communist, FBI spy, and Communist counter-spy, since they had asked him to follow other comrades to test their loyalty. Hence the 3 lives; and his family, co-workers, and church never knew. This TV show is based on the TRUE story of how Philbrick (played ably by Richard Carlson) could never relax, but had to sneak to secret cell meetings and meet FBI agents in clandestine places to make info drops, never knowing when he might be found out, and if he would live to see the next rendezvous.']","['According to the PBS special _""Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald?""

 I Love Lucy. ,Series, Comedy, CBS," Lucy and Ricky Ricardo are a happily married (but somewhat argumentative couple) who live at 623 East 68th Street in Manhattan in a converted brownstone that is owned by their good friends, Fred and Ethel Mertz. Lucy Esmerelda McGiUicuddy met Ricky Ricardo Alberto Fernando Acha (a.k.a. Ricky Alberto Ricardo IV) in New York City in 1941 when her friend Marian Strong arranged a blind date for her with Ricky. They fell in love and married shortly after. Ricky, a Cuban drummer who later has his own rumba band, performs at the Tropicana Club in Manhattan. In 1956 Ricky buys controlling interest in the Tropicana and renames it the Club Babalu (after his favorite song; the club is also called the Ricky Ricardo Babalu Club and the Babalu Club). Lucy was born in Jamestown, New York. She is, as some people call her, ""a wacky redhead,"" because all her good intentions always backfire and she gets into nothing but trouble. Lucy is fascinated by the world of show business and desperately wants to become a part of that world. She believes she can sing, dance and act, but Ricky refuses to let her enter his world. This sets the stage for most episode storylines as Lucy schemes to get what she wants most _æ and Ricky attempts to discourage her. Lucy is famous for her ""spider noise"" (""Eeeuuuuu""). Ricky couldn't always stop Lucy from doing what she wanted to do and she did acquire some show business jobs, she is most famous for her TV commercial on Your Saturday Night Variety Show _æ Vitameatavegamin, a vitamin product that contained meat, vegetables, minerals and 23 percent alcohol; naturally Lucy became intoxicated during rehearsals. In 1953 Lucy and Ricky became the parents with the birth of Ricky Ricardo, Jr. better known as Little Ricky. Ethel and Fred Mertz are former vaudevillians that met on the stage and later married. Fred is considered a cheapskate and always too frugal with a dollar according to Ethel. Ethel was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Fred in SteubenviUe, Ohio. He and Ricky are members of the Recreation Club. In European-based episodes (1955-1956) Fred becomes Ricky's band manager and the quartet books passage on the ocean liner SS Constitution. While visiting friends in Connecticut, Lucy falls in love with an Early American-style house for sale. She convinces Ricky to move. When they find the cost of living higher than expected, they decide to raise chickens and take in two borders _æ Fred and Ethel Mertz. Last season episodes follow their lives in the country.

 'Cuban Bandleader Ricky Ricardo would be happy if his wife Lucy would just be a housewife.

The first major show to be put on film rather than kinescope.']","[""The valentine heart figure, in the Opening Credits, Closing Credits & commercial breaks, shown in syndication today, was not the original Opening Credits' scenery. When the series originally aired on CBS, the Opening Credits featured animated clay figures of 'Lucille Ball' (qv) and 'Desi Arnaz' (qv) along with the sponsor's product - Phillip Morris cigarettes, for instance. The valentine heart figure was created and added for the Opening Credits and Closing Credits, when CBS began rerunning the series, in 1958.""

 '\'Gale Gordon\' (qv) was the first choice to play Fred Mertz, but he was not available. Their second choice, \'James Gleason (I)\' (qv) was also not available. When they came across \'William Frawley\' (qv), \'Desi Arnaz\' (qv) wanted him, even though he was told that Frawley would be a poor choice because he was a womanizer, a gambler, and an alcoholic. Arnaz said, ""He\'s perfect!"". The reason of Desi Arnaz\'s remark, is because both actors had the same type of personality, almost like identical twins, except their age difference and race. Frawley was an American and Arnaz was a Cuban Spaniard.'
 ""'Desi Arnaz' (qv) invented the rerun during the pregnancy episodes of the series by re-playing some episodes (and change some of the scenery and lines) from the first season to give 'Lucille Ball' (qv) time to rest and start to raise their new born son, 'Desi Arnaz Jr.' (qv).""
 ""When Lucy was pregnant with Little Ricky, ('Desi Arnaz Jr.' (qv) in reality), CBS network censors did not allow her to say the word, [pregnant]. She had to say [expecting] instead.""
 'This was one of the first TV shows to be filmed in Hollywood, at a time when many shows were done live in New York. It pioneered the use of three cameras simultaneously, and the results were high-quality prints of a classic comedy series preserved for future TV audiences.'
 'The full names of Fred and Ethel are Fredrick Hobart Mertz and Ethel Louise Roberta Mae Potter Mertz.'
 ""The Ricardos' address was 623 E. 68th Street. However, E. 68th Street in Manhattan only goes up to 600 - which means that the Ricardos' building was in the middle of the East River.""
 ""Three season one episodes, that were shown while 'Lucille Ball' (qv) was recovering after successfully bearing 'Desi Arnaz Jr.' (qv), on Monday, January 19th, 1953.

 ""'Lucille Ball' (qv) decided to go ahead with the series after having a dream in which 'Carole Lombard (I)' (qv) - the screwball comedy actress that died in a plane crash and who was a close friend of Lucy - recommended she take a shot at the risky idea of entering television, and to get off of radio.""
 'Lucy and Ricky\'s comic foils were initially going to be Ricky\'s agent and an out-of-work clown, but the parts were dropped when they did not prove successful in the series\' original and hidden pilot episode, _""I Love Lucy"" (1951) {Pilot (#1.0)}_ (qv) with \'Pepito Pérez\' (qv), as their comical clown. \'Lucille Ball\' (qv) was pregnant with their daughter, \'Lucie Arnaz\' (qv) while this was filmed.

 'While the Ricardos and the Mertzes were in Hollywood, the backdrop of Hollywood outside of the Ricardo\'s hotel suite replicates the view as it would have been seen from the top of the stages at the Desilu lot on Cahuenga Boulevard (now Ren-Mar Studios), two blocks to the west of Vine Street where a majority of the _""I Love Lucy"" (1951)_ (qv) episodes were shot. Most of the landmarks at Hollywood and Vine that are on the backdrop (except for the Brown Derby Restaurant, which was demolished in the 1980\'s) may still be seen at that location today, over fifty years later. The Capitol Records Building was under construction when these episodes were being filmed and is not seen on the backdrop. The ""Beverly Palms Hotel"" is a false hotel name, but its interior and exterior set designs combined elements of the Hollywood Plaza Hotel, the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel and the Beverly Hills Hotel.'
 ""During the course of living in their New York apartment, the Ricardos had three different telephone numbers. The first was Murray-Hill 5-9975, (which is 695-9975). Second was Circle-7-2099, (which is 247-2099). Their third and final number was Murray-Hill 5-9099, (which is 695-9099). In reality, these numbers were unused telephone numbers of the New York Bell Telephone Company. When the numbers were entered into service, the Bell company would advise the show's producers and give them a new number to use. Murray Hill and Circle were also actual call names used in Manhattan, during the 1950's.""
 ""Although they slept in twin beds throughout the entire run of the series, during the first two seasons of the show, 1951-1953, Ricky and Lucy slept in twin beds that were pushed together on the same box spring. Once little Ricky was born CBS suggested that the beds be pushed apart to diminish the impact of the suggested sexual history of Lucy and Ricky. The only time we see the Ricardo's in two bed pushed together again is when they first move to the bigger apartment into the Mertz' building, however, subsequently after that the beds are pushed apart again.""
 ""The back door, so often used in both the Ricardos' and Mertzes apartments was in actuality a common trait of older buildings in Los Angeles and not of those in New York.""
 'The program began as a radio program in 1948 called, ""My Favorite Husband"". And during the program, it was \'Richard Denning (I)\' (qv) who played Lucy\'s husband, on the radio. When CBS decided to take the show to television, it was \'Lucille Ball\' (qv)\'s personal idea to bring her real life husband, as of then, \'Desi Arnaz\' (qv), so she could act more natural and be easier.'
 'In March of 1977 a Disco version of the I Love Lucy theme became a hit single. It stayed on the dance charts for three months and on the pop charts for seven weeks.'

Ricky Ricardo, like \'Desi Arnaz\' (qv), was from Cuba, and both led their own Latin America bands. Ricky and Lucy, like Desi and Lucy, eloped to Connecticut to get married. Ethel Mertz, like \'Vivian Vance\' (qv), was from Albuquerque, New Mexico where they got their start in show business by appearing in the Albuquerque Little Theater.

 'All three sponsors of _""I Love Lucy"" (1951)_ (qv), were Philip Morris Cigarettes, Procter & Gamble\'s Cheer Detergent and Lilt Home Permanent.'
 ""There is a subtle hint in the series of the quick costume changes that go along with filming live TV shows: In many of the scenes where Lucy and Ricky are in bed, pay attention to when they are getting in and out of bed. Whenever they swing their feet in and out, you'll see that 'Desi Arnaz' (qv) is wearing black dress socks with his pajamas and 'Lucille Ball' (qv) is wearing stockings (you can see the reinforced toes and heels) under her pajamas or gowns, she was wearing, at their bedtime scenes.""

 '""I\'ve Got a Secret"" debuted on the heels of the successful ""What\'s My Line?"" Though ""Secret"" had somewhat similar rules, there were other elements that gave the show its own distinctive flavor. As with ""Line,"" four celebrity panelists try to guess an unknown-to-them secret, which the contestant (or sometimes group of contestants) whispered in the host\'s ear; the secret was always shown to the television and studio audience. Each panelist has one 30-second period to ask questions that will help them try to guess the secret; if a panelist fails to guess the secret before the buzzer sounds, the contestant(s) receive(s) $20 and the next panelist gets a turn. The process repeats until either the secret is guessed or if all four panelists are unable to guess the secret, meaning the contestant receives the maximum payout of $80 (during the early years, each panelist had two questioning periods, with $10 paid per unsuccessful try). Usually, a skit or demonstration of the secret followed each story. During the final segment of the show, a celebrity guest revealed his/her own secret, each followed by a segment, in which the panelists participated. Like ""What\'s My Line,"" ""Secret"" had millions of faithful viewers during its CBS run, and spawned a number of revivals (including a weekly syndicated series in 1972 and a 2000 revival on the Oxygen network). Reruns of the CBS series currently air as part of Game Show Network\'s Black and White Overnight programming block.'
 'The format for ""I\'ve Got a Secret"" was both simple and durable. Four panelists took turns questioning the person with the secret to determine exactly what the secret was. A nominal financial award was given to a contestant whose secret (flashed on the TV screen for the viewing audience) could not be guessed by the panel. Each show gave three regular contestants an opportunity to stump the panel, and also had one celebrity guest with his own secret to hide.']","[""Regular panelist 'Betsy Palmer' (qv) served as a temporary hostess on more than one occasion while 'Garry Moore (I)' (qv) was on vacation.""

After she uncovered it, Moore explained to her, the other panelists and viewers that when John Wilkes Booth jumped down from the presidential box at Fords Theatre immediately after shooting Lincoln, five-year-old Seymour witnessed only that jump without knowing that any shots had been fired.

 Johnny Jupiter. ,Series, Comedy," DuMont, ABC"," In the mythical town of Clayville, U.S.A., lives Ernest P. Duckweather, a mild mannered clerk at the Frisby General Store. Horatio Frisby, who attended Hyldeberg University, owns the store; and Katherine Frisby, Horatio's daughter, is Ernest's girlfriend. Ernest, who earns $15 a week, is a jack-of-alltrades. He accidentally discovered interplanetary television when he fooled around with a television set and contacted the inhabitants of Jupiter. The planet is 600 million miles from Earth, and the Jupiterians we see are puppets Johnny Jupiter, Major Domo (the head robot) and Reject, ""the factory rejected robot"" (all voiced by Gilbert Mack). Stories relate Ernest's misadventures as he seeks the Jupiterians' help in solving his earthly problems. When Ernest contacts Johnny, he turns several dials on a large television and says, ""Duckweather on Earth, calling the planet Jupiter."" Through some primitive but effective special effects, Jupiter comes into view. Ernest can see and speak to Johnny and vice versa. If Ernest requires extraordinary help, Johnny sends Reject the Robot to Earth. To accomplish this, Johnny touches the puppet Reject and says, ""Super Jelly Bean Power."" Reject is sent through space and appears to Ernest (the only one who can see him). During the trip from Jupiter to Earth, the puppet becomes life-sized (the actor playing the robot is not credited). Reject's favorite television show is ""The Robot Club"" ( Jupiterian television programs are all educational and instructive). On Jupiter, robots were built to service the humanoid inhabitants (for example, Johnny) and are excellent repairmen. Johnny calls Ernest ""Mr. Duckweather."" Reta Shaw (as Mrs. Clandish, a townsperson) and Florenz Ames (as Mr. Latham, Horatio's nemesis) were semi-regulars in this version of the series (ABC owned and operated stations; syndicated elsewhere). An earlier version aired on DuMont. Here Ernest P. Duckweather (Vaughn Taylor) is a television station janitor who dreams of becoming a producer. One night he sneaks into the control room and begins playing producer. While fiddling with the various controls, he accidentally discovers interplanetary television when he contacts the people of Jupiter (puppets Johnny Jupiter; Major Domo, ""the head robot""; Reject, ""the factory rejected robot""; and Johnny's pal, B-12). Due to limited available information, it is difficult to compare both versions.It appears that the DuMont version, which was broadcast live, had only two actors: Vaughn Taylor as Ernest and Gilbert Mack doubling as Ernest's boss at the television station and as the puppet voices. Stories revolved around Johnny and Ernest assessing the values of their respective planets (which differed greatly; what was commonplace on Earth was usually just the opposite on Jupiter). An announcer opens the show: ""Time now for M&amp;M's presentation of Johnny Jupiter. Once upon a time on the far off planet Jupiter lived two strange creatures (Johnny Jupiter, Major Domo). Strange in looks but with a wisdom far greater than our own. Each day they searched the universe for signs of intelligent life but alas they found none. Instead they settled for the planet Earth. Now on this planet lived a young inventor by the name of Ernest Duckweather. He invented a television set unlike any known before. For on this set he was able to tune in the planet Jupiter.

The railroad has started laying track going east and there is also a lot of trouble _æ from outlaws who find the town an easy mark. To stop the growing crime rate, Mayor Hartford (Willis Bouchey) hires Johnny Ringo, an exgunfighter, as the town's sheriff. Johnny, a righthanded gunfighter, receives $200 a month and has to prove he is as fast as his reputation _æ ""Velardi didn't hire me, they hired my guns. I know that and got to live with it. Maybe someday it will be different."" Johnny doesn't know much about the law _æ he puts things on a personal basis. He philosophizes, and people say he sounds more like a preacher than a gunfighter. He sometimes poses as a wanted man and calls on his reputation as a gunfighter to apprehend criminals. Johnny never killed a man for money. He relinquished his gun fighting career to become a lawman and recalled that he didn't know how he came to be a gunfighter: ""I don't know, it just grew.... All of a sudden you're a big man andyou find yourself like a turkey in a shoot. Everybody wants to try their luck. You can't stop it, you wanna but you can't. You run, but they catch you; you hide, but they find you. Perhaps the badge will make up for some of the things I did."" Johnny's gun is a variation on the French firearm, the Le Met Special. It was designed by Cason (""Case"") Thomas, Johnny's original deputy, ""to even up the odds."" Cason calls it ""a seven shooter."" It looks like a regular Colt .45 and fires the normal six bullets. But there is a separate barrel for an extra shell _æ a .410 shotgun shell (the seventh barrel, located under the standard one, is activated by setting the gun's hammer in the firing position). It was said that Johnny's reputation was known from the Gulf to the Pacific Ocean. William Charles, Jr., better known as Cully, is Johnny's young deputy. Cully's father was a trick shot and taught him how to use a gun when he was five years old. Four years later Cully's father was killed, and Cully went to work as a roustabout in a carnival. He practiced shooting every day and eventually became a traveling show attraction called ""Kid Adonis, the Fastest Gun in the World."" When the show came to Velardi and the Kid found Johnny was a split second faster than he was, he decided to settle down and lead a normal life. When Cason tells Cully that he is getting too old for the job. Cully steps into his shoes and becomes Johnny's deputy. Cason buys the general store (which he runs with his daughter and Johnny's romantic interest, Laura Thomas). The town saloon is the Golden Wheel.

 Timmy and Lassie. ,Series, Drama, CBS," A continuation of the Jeff's Collie (which see) version of the Lassie series. Shortly after the death of Helen's grandfather. Cramps, a sevenyear-old boy named Timmy runs away from an orphanage. He is found by Lassie and brought to the Miller Farm and given a temporary home by Ellen and her son, Jeff. Ellen, who is alone and unable to run the farm, sells it to Paul and Ruth Martin, a childless couple who later adopt Timmy. Jeff, who is unable to take Lassie to the city with him, gives her to Timmy. Stories relate the adventures shared by a boy and his dog. Timmy and Lassie is the syndicated title for the  1957-1964 episodes of Lassie. Petrie Martin is Timmy's uncle; Boomer Bates is Timmy's friend; Dr. Frank Weaver is the veterinarian; Harry Miller is the sheriff; Cully Wilson is Timmy's friend; Scott is Timmy's friend. Boomer's dog is Mike; Cully's dog is Silky. Cast: Jon Provost (Timmy Martin), Cloris Leachman (Ruth Martin), June Lockhart (Ruth Martin; later), Jon Shepodd (Paul Martin), Hugh Riley (Paul Martin; later), Todd Ferrell (Boomer Bates), Arthur Space (Dr. Frank Weaver), Robert Fouik (Sheriff Harry Miller), Andy Clyde (Cully Wilson), Ricky Allen (Scott), Jan Clayton (Helen Miller), Tommy Rettig (Jeff Miller). ",1957,1964,[None 'Adventure' 'Drama' 'Family'],[None],"['All the Lassies were actually male dogs because female collies tend to ""blow coat"" (go through a massive hormone-induced shedding process) with each heat cycle. While males blow coat as well in reaction to a change in season, it is much less noticeable than what occurs with an intact female. By the time that spaying, which would reduce the dramatic shedding of the female, became commonplace, it had become tradition to use a male in the role. Additionally, it was believed that males, who often outweigh their female counterparts by as much as fifteen pounds, would look more impressive on film.'
 'This was one of the first long-running television shows to remain in its time slot and day of the week during its entire prime-time run on a US television network. It became a syndicated program for the last three years of its run.'
 'The only program to regularly bump ""Lassie"" off the air in the USA was the annual CBS television showing of _The Wizard of Oz (1939)_ (qv), which, from 1959 to 1967, always took place on a Sunday evening.'
 '\'Pal (I)\' (qv), the first ever dog to play the legendary dog ""Lassie"" in _Lassie Come Home (1943)_ (qv), appeared in the pilot of this TV series (broadcast as the first two episodes). It was his last appearance before his death in 1958.'
 'Although it has been the subject of many spoofs and misquotes, the one situation that Timmy never needed saving from in the entire history of the show was falling down a well.'
 'The famous ""whistle"" theme associated with the show\'s opening and closing credits was not actually introduced until Season 5. The previous four seasons used a more traditional orchestral theme for its opening and closing music.'

The Apache, named Sam Buckhart, responds, ""I do."" While Sam covers a great deal of New Mexico (1880s), he is based in Santa Fe and must overcome many obstacles to perform his job _æ especially the prejudices that existed at the time between Indians and whites. But it was a white man who changed the course of Sam's life. During a battle between the cavalry and the Apache Indians, a 14-year-old brave encounters a wounded army captain. Instead of kiUing the captain, the brave befriends him and gets help. The captain and the brave, whom the captain names Sam Burkhart, soon become blood brothers.

 Lawman. ,Series, Western, ABC," When a girl, ""someone special"" to Dan Troop, is killed by a stray bullet in a pointless gunfight, Dan decides to devote his life to upholding the law. As the years pass, Dan becomes a legend _æ ""The Famous Gun from Texas."" It is 1879 when Dan, the marshal of Abilene, receives a telegram from the town council in Laramie, Wyoming, asking him to rid the town of three outlaw brothers, one of whom killed the previous marshal (""The town is tough on lawmen and horse thieves""). Dan is fast with his guns and tough with his fists. He is also high priced and likes his gratitude once a month _æ waiting for him at the bank. The town council members want a city where their wives and children can walk down the street without being afraid. Dan realizes that he can't do the job alone and advertises for a deputy (a job that pays $50 a month). A young man named Johnny McKay applies for the position _æ but is turned down because Dan thinks Johnny is too inexperienced. However, when Dan arrests one of the three brothers and the other two trap him in a crossfire, Johnny comes to his defense _æ and is hired by Dan. Stories follow their efforts to uphold the law. As a kid Dan worked in a hash house. He believes that a man has to wear a gun because of the way things are now; he also thinks there will be a time when it is not necessary. Lily Merrill owns the town's watering hole, the Birdcage Saloon; Dru Lemp runs the Blue Bonnet Cafe (where Johnny worked prior to becoming a deputy; it was then called Good Eats); and Julie Tate is the editor of the town newspaper, the Laramie Weekly (originally called the Laramie Free Press).

Since the climactic moment of so many shows was the classic quick-draw shoot-out, the actors had to acquire that skill to play their scenes. The magazine held a competition among some of the stars of the shows, firing blanks, aiming not at each other but downrange, and using an electronic timer.

However, Beaver continues to end up in one kind of jam or another.

 ""The Cleavers - father Ward, mother June, older son Wally and younger son Theodore (nicknamed Beaver) - are a loving, middle class family living in the small town of Mayfield. Despite getting along as a family most of the time, they sometimes have to deal with problems in Wally and/or Beaver's life resulting from the generation gap, and the differing mentalities on the same issue by adult parents and their children. Even the six year age difference between Wally and Beaver is enough for each to have a different viewpoint of the world than the other. Generally, Beaver will go through the same issues as Wally in dealing with their parents, only six years later. When disputes or differences happen between the generations, often Wally and/or Beaver's friends, who have much the same mentality as Wally or Beaver, but only from an outsider's perspective, will add fuel to the already blazing fire.

 Leave It to Beaver. ,Series, Comedy," CBS, ABC"," Ward and June Cleaver and their children, Wally and Theodore, live at 211 Pine Street in the small town of Mayfield. Before the Cleavers move to a new home at 211 Lakewood Avenue, their address was also given as 211 Maple Street and 211 Pine Avenue. In the first episode only, the Cleavers have a maid named Minerva.Ward enjoys fishing and reading the Mayfield Press. He grew up on Shannon Avenue (in the Shaker Heights section of town) and was a member of the  4H Club. He was on the shot put team in high school and studied engineering in college. He was also an engineer with the Seabees during World War II but his current profession (other than being a businessman) is not revealed. He and June are strict but not stern parents. They never spank their sons but when it comes to punishing or disciplining them, a ""go to your room"" or sermon by Ward is given. June, maiden name Bronson, was educated in a boarding school (where she received a letter in basketball). Wallace, nicknamed Wally, is the older brother. He is in the eighth grade at the Grant Avenue School when the series begins. He later attends Mayfield High School then State College. In high school Wally becomes a three-letter man. He is captain of the varsity football team and has a girlfriend (Julie Foster). Theodore is named after June's Aunt Martha's brother. He acquired the nickname of ""Beaver"" when Wally couldn't pronounce Theodore and said ""Tweder."" Ward and June thought ""Beaver"" sounded better. Beaver, also called the ""Beave,"" attends the Grant Avenue School and then Mayfield High. He wears a green baseball cap, hates ""mushy stuff"" and likes ""to mess around with junk."" He would ""rather smell a skunk than see a girl"" and Miller's Pond is his favorite ""fishin' hole."" Mary Margaret Matthews (Lori Martin) was the first girl Beaver found attractive (she called him ""Teddy""). Edward W. Haskell, better known as Eddie, is Wally's wisecracking friend (he and Wally met in the second grade). Eddie is extremely polite to adults (he fears their authority) but mean to everyone else, especially Beaver (whom he calls ""Squirt""; he calls Wally ""Sam,"" ""Gertrude"" and ""Ellwood""). Eddie attends the same schools as Wally and lives at 175 Grant Avenue. Woody Woodpecker is his favorite TV show and he is allergic to mayonnaise. Clarence Rutherford, the overweight friend of Wally and Eddie, is nicknamed ""Lumpy."" He takes tuba lessons and drives ""a sickly green car"" and his father, Fred, is Ward's boss. Fred calls Ward ""Lord of the Manor."" He is married to Geraldine; his wife in later episodes is named Gwen. Fred originally talked about having three children: a girl, Violet, and two boys who were offered football scholarships. Later, he has only two children. Lumpy and Violet. Beaver's friends are Larry Mondello, Gilbert Grover and Hubert ""Whitey"" Whitney. Larry was first credited as Robert Stevens; Gilbert was first introduced as Gilbert Harrison, then Gilbert Gates and finally Gilbert Bates. Judy Hessler is the obnoxious girl who kisses up to teachers and annoys Beaverand his friends with her smug attitude. She was replaced by Penny Woods, a similar character, in lastseason episodes. Cornelia Raeburn is the principal of the Grant Avenue School, Alice Landers is Beaver's caring teacher, and Gus is the old fire chief Beaver visits at Fire Station Number 5.

 ""The Cleavers are the 1950's 'All-American Family' in this 'feel-good' family sitcom. Parents Ward and June, and older brother Wally, try to keep Theodore ('the Beaver') out of trouble. However, Beaver continues to end up in one kind of jam or another. Unlike real life, these situations are always easily resolved to the satisfaction of all involved and the Beaver gets off with a few stern moralistic words of parental advice. Instigator and troublemaker Eddie Haskell is an older kid who always manages to avoid being caught.""
 ""The Cleavers - father Ward, mother June, older son Wally and younger son Theodore (nicknamed Beaver) - are a loving, middle class family living in the small town of Mayfield. Despite getting along as a family most of the time, they sometimes have to deal with problems in Wally and/or Beaver's life resulting from the generation gap, and the differing mentalities on the same issue by adult parents and their children. Even the six year age difference between Wally and Beaver is enough for each to have a different viewpoint of the world than the other. Generally, Beaver will go through the same issues as Wally in dealing with their parents, only six years later. When disputes or differences happen between the generations, often Wally and/or Beaver's friends, who have much the same mentality as Wally or Beaver, but only from an outsider's perspective, will add fuel to the already blazing fire. Chief amongst them is Wally's trouble-making and two-faced best friend, Eddie Haskell.""]","[""The address of the first house the Cleavers owned in Mayfield was 485 Mapleton Drive, a reference to first season network CBS's then New York headquarters at 485 Madison Avenue.

In addition to calling everyone by random names (noted elsewhere on this Trivia page), he would often break into jazzy song quotes. One of his favorites was ""C\'est si bon"" (composed in 1947 by \'Henri Betti\' (qv) with the lyrics by \'André Hornez\' (qv), and ""covered"" by literally scores of singers during the 1950s and 1960s). In two episodes of Season 3 (_""Leave It to Beaver"" (1957) {The Hypnotist (#3.24)}_ (qv) and _""Leave It to Beaver"" (1957) {Wally\'s Play (#3.37)}_ (qv)) he is heard singing, ""Baby won\'t you please come home/Your lovin\' daddy\'s all alone"". The words are from a song written in 1919 by \'Charles Garfield\' (qv) (with the possible assistance of Clarence Williams). Eddie may be ""quoting"" either the \'Frank Sinatra\' (qv) (1957) version or the \'Ricky Nelson (I)\' (qv) recording (1960) of the song.'
 'No episodes in the entire series featured snow or snowfall.'
 'A hint as to where the Cleavers may have lived. In season 2 EP 16 ""The boat builders"" Tooey tell Mr. Cleaver they are going to test the boat in Miller\'s pond before they take it to the ocean. Ward later tells June not to worry the ocean is twenty miles away.'
 'In the episode, ""Bachelor at Large"", Eddie sings ""Come-on-a my house, I want to give you candy"" to the boys after he invites them over for the weekend. ""Come on-a My House"" was originally recorded by Rosemary Clooney in 1951. The song was written by Ross Bagdasarian (Alvin & the Chipmunks) and his cousin, William Saroyan (a Pulitzer Prize winning author) in 1939.'
 ""SPOILER: Cleavers probably lived in Washington State which is near ocean and would make sense when Eddie was going to work on tuna boat. Can't be California because June stated how far away California was and also can't be Florida because beavers friend was looking at Cleavers mail and stated he didn't know beaver had an uncle in Florida. Remember Ward stated they were within 20 miles from ocean.""

This was done in part because the producers claimed there simply wasn't enough time to re-write proper conclusions for all the story lines. Another reason was that the producers were hoping that another network would pickup the series, but this was not the case. Consequently, the final airing of the series, ended on a cliffhanger that was never resolved. Longtime fans were shocked and outraged that the story lines were left unresolved.""

 Make Room for Daddy. ,Series, Comedy," ABC, CBS"," Danny Williams, his wife, Margaret, and their children, Terry and Rusty, live at the Parkside Apartments (Apartment 1204) in Manhattan. Danny is a night club entertainer who performs at the Copa Club in New York City. He was born in Toledo, Ohio, and attended Ursuline Academy (in another episode, Danny mentions he was born in Deerfield, Michigan, raised in Toledo, and attended Woodward High School). Danny, 24, met his future wife, Margaret Summers, when she was 17 years old. He was a strugglingyoung stand-up comedian; she worked as a parttime waitress and piano player (in another episode, Margaret mentions she and Danny have known each other since they were children). Margaret was born in Baraboo, Wisconsin, and was cared for by Mom and Pop Finch while her parents were on the road in vaudeville. The family has a pet dog named Laddie. Actress Jean Hagen wanted to leave the series. The 1955 season ended with Danny's emotional talk with Terry and Rusty that their mother ""had gone to Heaven."" The following season found Danny as a widower struggling to raise two children with the help of his maid, Louise. Various actresses were brought on to date Danny and win over the affections of his children. At the close of the 1956-57 season, Danny hires Kathleen ""Kathy"" O'Hara, a widowed nurse, to care for Rusty, who had come down with a case of the measles. Kathy, the mother of a young daughter named Patty, soon catches the measles and is quarantined in the Williams apartment. A romance develops and Danny proposes to Kathy (ending the ABC series). When the CBS series begins in 1957 (now called The Danny Thomas Show) Danny and Kathy are married and Kathy's daughter is now Linda. Kathy was born in Peoria, Illinois. She and Danny honeymooned in Las Vegas. The CBS episodes find the Williams family now living at 505 East 56th Street (Apartment 542; also given as 781) in Manhattan. Danny calls Kathy ""Clancy"" and her maiden name is also given as Daly. Although they have a maid, Kathy can be seen cleaning the apartment in many episodes. Teresa (Terry) is Danny's oldest child. She attended West Side High School then goes to an unnamed college (where she is a member of the Alpha Beta Chi sorority). At this point Terry was written out but returned to marry Pat Hannigan, a night club performer. Russell (Rusty) was born on February 15, 1947. He attended PS. 54, Claremont Junior High School and then West Side High. His first crush was on a girl named Sylvia Watkins (Pamela Beaird) and he felt the best part of school was recess, lunch and holidays. (He is the best speller in his class and won several spelling bees. He always seems to get ""a leaky old fountain pen."") Linda attends ES. 54 and has milk and cookies when she comes home from school. She believes in the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus. In Terry's absence, Danny sponsored Italian high school exchange student Gina Minelli. She attends West Side High and tutors the school's star football players. Buck Weaver and Bronco Lewis (Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside on the team). Danny's Uncle Tonoose is the self-proclaimed head of the family.

" Martin Kane, Private Eye. ",Series, Crime Drama, NBC," Martin Kane is a rugged private detective working out of New York City. He has an office in the Wood Building in Manhattan. The sign on his office door reads Martin Kane-Private Investigator. Kane charges fees that he feels are appropriate to the case at hand _æ as much as $500. He uses determination and force of character to achieve results. He refers to women as ""Doll Face"" and ""Sweetheart"" and his hangout is McMann's Tobacco Shop. Kane smokes a pipe and uses Old Briar pipe tobacco at 15 cents a pouch. The shop is a vital part of the live series, as the sponsor's products are prominently displayed. When Kane discusses a case with shop owner Tucker ""Hap"" McMann, customers appear to purchase a product. Hap excuses himself and pitches the sponsor's product while Kane, or someone else involved with the case, waits patiently on the side. With the sale concluded, the show picks up from where the customer entered. When Kane places tobacco in his pipe, the camera zooms in for a closeup of the product name. Hap was replaced by Don Morrow, who played himself in last season episodes, as the owner of the tobacco shop. Also known as Assignment Danger, the title used when the series was first re-syndicated after its initial run. See also The New Adventures of Martin Kane.

 Maverick. ,Series, Western, ABC," Bret and Bart Maverick are brothers. They are gentlemen gamblers who roam the Old West in search of rich prey. They are also cowards at heart, but more often than not they find themselves helping people in trouble. They are unconventional, selfcentered and untrustworthy, and they possess a genius for conning the con man. Although they served with the Confederacy during the Civil War, they became Union soldiers when they were captured and figured it would be better to help the enemy than spend time in a Union prison camp. As ""Galvanized Yankees"" (as Bart puts it), they were assigned to keep the Indians under control out West. At this same time, it is mentioned that another Maverick, Cousin Beauregard (Beau), became a family disgrace when he was honored as a war hero. Beauregard (""Pappy"") Maverick, the head of the family, instilled in his sons his cowardice and conartist genius. When Pappy, as he is called, learned that his nephew. Beau, did something to bring honor to the Maverick name, he branded him ""the white sheep of the family"" and banished him to England. (Actually, Beau had been captured. While he was playing poker with a Union general, the Confederates attacked the camp. Just as the general lost a game and exclaimed, ""Son, I give up,"" Confederate troops entered the tent. Beau was credited with the capture.) To make up for this family disgrace, Beau spent five years tarnishing his ""good"" name and was actually brought on (1960-61) to replace James Garner (who left the series in 1960). The following year, and until 1962, another brother. Brent, appeared when Roger Moore left at the end of the 1961 season. It is against a Maverick's principles to drink alone, and they have one serious vice _æ curiosity. The Mavericks are from Little Bent, Texas, and a sheriff is not their best friend. A Maverick is not fast on the draw (if there is a way to get out of a gunfight, they will find it). Bret promised his Pappy that on his thirty-eighth birthday he would find himself a wife and raise 12 Mavericks. Bart, who enjoys smoking cigars, often says, ""Sometimes it frightens me what I'll do for money."" Bret contends that he is a cautious man _æ ""It's the other faults that bother me."" Bret calls Bart ""Brother Bart,"" and Beau has a horse named Gumlegs. Although Beauregard (""Pappy"") Maverick appeared only once (in the episode, ""Pappy""), his proverbs became an established part of the series. One of the Mavericks would exclaim, ""As my old Pappy would say,"" followed by the saying (forexample, ""No use crying over spilled milk, it could have been whiskey""). Pappy is a ladies' man and a gambler like his sons (but women call him ""an old coot"" and ""a lecherous old goat""). On screen. Pappy is credited as ""Pappy...?"" Jack Kelly also played Pappy's brother, Bentley Maverick, in ""Pappy."" Besides the Indians, the outlaws and the sheriff, another threat to Bret and Bart was Samantha (""Sam"") Crawford, a beautiful con artist who was just as cunning and clever as the Mavericks. A Northern girl at heart, Sam faked a Southern accent and used, besides her genius at the con, her feminine wiles to acquire easy money. Gentleman Jack Darby and Dandy Jim Buckley are gamblers who also sought easy money and easy prey. Theme: ""Maverick,"" by David Buttolph and Paul Francis Webster.

 ""Bret and Bart Maverick (and in later seasons, their English cousin, Beau) are well dressed gamblers who migrate from town to town always looking for a good game. Poker (five-card draw) is their favorite but they've been known to play such odd card games as Three-toed Sloth on occasion. The show would occasionally feature both or all three Mavericks, but usually would rotate the central character from week to week.""
 'Brothers Bret and Bart Maverick (usually separately, but sometimes together) travel across the West trying to stay out of trouble and make a lot of money. The Mavericks preferred playing cards rather than engaging in any sort of manual labor, and, if in trouble, would prefer to leave town than stay and fight.']","['\'James Garner (I)\' (qv) claimed that during filming one day, they had less than an hour until overtime would have to be paid, but they still needed to shoot a complicated fight scene. Spying a group of tall weeds, he suggested that he throw his opponent into the weeds and have the fight proceed with much shaking of the weeds, and people being ejected from the weeds, only to immediately run back in. The results were extremely funny, and thus the cast and crew began to look for ""funny"" ways to cut corners, turning the show into a semi-comedy.'
 'Series creator \'Roy Huggins (I)\' (qv) never received on-screen credit for this show. In the 1950s, Warner Brothers wanted to avoid paying royalties to creators, and wanted all television projects to be based on properties held by the studio.

Huggins wouldn\'t get credit until _Maverick (1994)_ (qv), the film version with \'Mel Gibson (I)\' (qv).'
 ""In 1960, 'James Garner (I)' (qv) sued the Warner Brothers studio for breach of contract, arising from his suspension during the writers' strike of that year. Warner claimed that there were no scripts available during the strike and were, therefore, justified in suspending Garner without pay. However, it was learned during court testimony that the studio had secretly obtained approximately one hundred television scripts during the strike. Eventually, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled in favor of Garner, and he was released from his contract with the series.""
 'Producer \'Roy Huggins (I)\' (qv) stated the writers\' guiding principle for the Maverick series was his belief that, ""In the traditional Western, the situation was always serious, but never hopeless. In a \'Maverick\' story, the situation is always hopeless, but never serious.""'
 ""'Jack Kelly (I)' (qv)'s role as Bart Maverick was originally supposed to be just a one shot deal. However, the producers saw the great chemistry that he had with 'James Garner (I)' (qv), and decided to keep him as a regular.""
 ""'Jack Kelly (I)' (qv) was the only Maverick star to appear in all five seasons of the series.""
 'By adding the Bart Maverick character (and later cousin Beau and brother Brent) this allowed for more episodes of the show to be filmed each season.'
 'During season one, Bret competes in a boxing match, and uses the ""rope-a-dope"" strategy (letting the other fighter tire himself out and them coming back to beat him), several years before \'Muhammad Ali (I)\' (qv) made it famous.'
 ""Even though Bret was older than Bart, 'Jack Kelly (I)' (qv) was nearly seventh months older than 'James Garner (I)' (qv).""
 ""In addition to making regular appearances as Big Mike McComb, 'Leo Gordon (I)' (qv) also wrote several episodes of the series.""
 ""Sir 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv) left the series after his contract ended. However, there were still episodes left to filmed for season four, so the producers cast 'Robert Colbert (I)' (qv) as the youngest Maverick brother, Brent.""
 ""During the first season, 'James Garner (I)' (qv) filmed several vignettes that aired at the beginning of the 'Jack Kelly (I)' (qv) only episodes, where he would introduce the evening's story. This was done in order to get viewers used to the idea of a second Maverick.""
 ""Sir 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv) left the series over what he felt was a decline in script quality. Moore said that if the scripts would have been like the Garner scripts from the earlier seasons, he would have been glad to stay.""
 ""Sir 'Sean Connery' (qv) was originally offered the role of Beau Maverick, but turned it down. As a sign of things to come, Sir 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv) would once again replace Connery years later in the James Bond franchise.""
 ""During the fifth season, the studio would alternate with new episodes featuring 'Jack Kelly (I)' (qv), and re-runs featuring 'James Garner (I)' (qv). The introduction was also changed to give Kelly the top billing since Garner had been long gone from the series by then.""
 ""The studio wanted 'Jack Kelly (I)' (qv), Sir 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv), and 'Robert Colbert (I)' (qv) to appear together, but Moore had left the series by the time Colbert filmed his first episode.""
 ""On April 21, 2006, a ten foot tall statue of 'James Garner (I)' (qv) as Bret Maverick was unveiled in Garner's hometown of Norman, Oklahoma. Garner was on hand for the festivities.""
 'The producers cast \'Robert Colbert (I)\' (qv) as Brent Maverick, due to having a similar look to \'James Garner (I)\' (qv), and they even ordered him to wear a costume identical to that worn by Garner. Because of the obvious comparisons this would bring, Colbert told them, ""Put me in a dress and call me Brenda, but don\'t do this to me!""'
 '\'Diane Brewster\' (qv) originated the role of Samantha Crawford on _""Cheyenne"" (1955)_ (qv).'
 ""'Rod Taylor (I)' (qv) and 'Stuart Whitman' (qv) were considered for the role of Bart Maverick.""
 'From 1958 to 1962, eighteen issues of Maverick Comics were published.'
 ""During two episodes of season four, Sir 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv) whistled the show's theme song.""
 'While running for mayor of Huntington Beach, California, \'Jack Kelly (I)\' (qv) used the slogan, ""Let Maverick Solve Your Problems.""'
 ""This series featured two different takes on Doc Holliday. In the first season, 'Gerald Mohr' (qv) played Holliday as a hard living, ruthless gunslinger. In seasons four and five, 'Peter Breck' (qv) played Holliday as more of a comedic rogue that was constantly getting Bart in trouble with his various schemes.""
 'After \'Adam West (I)\' (qv) made several guest spots as various villains on this show, \'Jack Kelly (I)\' (qv) would later return the favor by playing a villain on _""Batman"" (1966)_ (qv). He guest starred as Jack O\'Shea, a crooked newspaper columnist that was secretly employed by Catwoman.'
 'According to Sir \'Roger Moore (I)\' (qv) in his autobiography, he was assured that he was not being brought in to replace \'James Garner (I)\' (qv). However, when he went to the costume department, all his clothes had the name ""Jim Garner"" semi-scratched out on them.'
 ""Sir 'Roger Moore (I)' (qv) said when his parents came to visit him on-set, his mother, who was a huge Western fan, got to meet guest star 'Lee Van Cleef' (qv), who was one of her favorite actors.""
 'Even though \'James Garner (I)\' (qv) had left the series, he, \'Jack Kelly (I)\' (qv), Sir \'Roger Moore (I)\' (qv), and their wives regularly got together for what they called ""poker school"" at the Kelly home on Sunset Boulevard.'
 'According to Sir \'Roger Moore (I)\' (qv), the studio decided to punish the actors at one point for protesting the long hours on the set by putting a time clock in the make-up department. Actors had to punch in every morning. Moore refused, brought his own make-up, and never punched in. Moore said that \'Jack Kelly (I)\' (qv) was ""similarly minded, and one day took the time clock and used it as a football.""'
 'If you watch the episode ""Shady Deal at Sunny Acres"", It seems that the plot of The Sting (1973), starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, was lifted from this ""Maverick"" story.'
 '""Oh, Dem Golden Slippers"", a minstrel standard, is used as background music many, many times as a piano song during saloon scenes.'

The hero of our saga is Robinson J. Peepers, an army corporal who returns to teaching (general science) after an honorable discharge (poor eyesight). Robinson is gentle and kind, and his students are all his fans. He is also timid and shy and easily taken advantage of. Robinson was born in the neighboring town of WiUiamsport where his mother, ""Ma Peepers,"" and his sister, Agnes Peepers, still live (Agnes is a teacher at the Jefferson Observatory; Mrs. F.R. Peepers is the name on the mailbox) . Robinson talks directly to the audience when he feels the need. Royala Dean, the school's music teacher, was Robinson's first love interest. When the series, intended only to be a summer replacement for The James Melton Show, achieved high ratings, it was quickly brought back to replace the Eddie Mayehoff series. Doc Corkle, which was canceled after three episodes. Robinson's new love interest was Nancy Remington, the school nurse. They became engaged in the episode of 4/25/54 and married on 5/23/54 (Sylvia Field and Ernest Truex appeared as Nancy's parents. For this particular episode, 50 couples, honeymooning in New York City, occupied the studio audience). Harvey Weskit is the history teacher. He is married to Marge and is best friends with Robinson (whom he calls ""Ace"" and ""Rob""; Marge calls him ""Robbie""). Marge and Harvey became parents of a baby boy (1954) they named Harrison Brookfield Weskit. Marge was born in Chicago, and Robinson calls Harvey, who was best man at his wedding, ""Wes."" Mrs. Gurney is the wife of school principal Gabriel Gurney and is an English teacher. She fusses, mutters to herself, sentimentalizes and forgets what she is about to say (she is almost identical to ""Aunt Clara,"" the character she played on Bewitched). Gage Clark as Mr. Bascomb, became the principal inl954. Frank T. Whipp III is the school's coach; Madeline Schreiber is one of Robinson's students. Bernie Green composed the theme. A narrator opens the show: ""NBC television presents Mister Peepers. Created by David Swift. And now, here's Jefferson City's most popular general science teacher, Robinson J. Peepers.""

 Mr. and Mrs. North. ,Series, Crime Drama," CBS, NBC"," ""To Jerry, with Love, Pam,"" is the inscription on the pocket watch Pamela North gave to her husband, Gerald (""Jerry"") North, on the occasion of their first wedding anniversary. (They have been married five years when the series begins. Pam and Jerry married on a Friday afternoon during Pam's lunch hour and honeymooned in Paris.) Jerry, a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II, is a former private detective who relinquished the rough life for a peaceful existence as a publisher (for an unidentified house). Pamela is young, beautiful and fashion conscious, and she believes she possesses the mind of a detective (when she sees something that is wrong, she immediately associates it with foul play). Much to Jerry's regret, Pam is most often right and he finds himself playing detective again to solve a crime. It is unfair to give Jerry all the credit. Pam does solve crimes on her own. She is so unassuming that the culprit is unaware of her brilliance and is caught by surprise. Pam is extremely proud of herself at these moments and tells Jerry, ""If I hadn't used my brains, I'd be dead. You'd have a corpse for a wife."" (Unfortunately, Pam tells Jerry this when he is trying to sleep or is involved with a manuscript; the remark falls virtually on deaf ears _æ ""Yes, honey, that's nice, dear.""

The girl to whom Robert is a hero is Julie Marshall, a red haired, brown eyed beauty who works as the office secretary. Julie sees Robert as other women do (a playboy bachelor), but she also sees a side of him that other women do not _æ his somewhat klutzy approach to selling properties when he becomes desperate.

 My Little Margie. ,Series, Comedy," CBS, NBC"," As the opening theme music is heard, the audience sees the framed pictures of two people: a beautiful 21-year-old girl named Marjorie (""Margie"") Albright, and her distinguished father, Vernon (""Vern"") Albright. The camera first focuses on the portrait of Vern. The picture comes to life and we learn about his problem _æ Margie: ""I've been both mother and father to her since she was born. She's grown up now.... When she was little I could speak to her and make her mind me. I had control over her.... When she disobeyed, I took her roller skates away for a week. What can you do when a girl reaches this age? She's completely out of hand. I've got a problem, believe me, I've got a problem."" The camera pans to the picture of Margie and we learn of her problem _æ Vern: ""I've raised him from my childhood. He's nearly 50 now and you'd think he'd settle down, wouldn't you? Today, he looks better in shorts on a tennis court than fellows 25. Girls wink at him, and what's worse, he winks back at them. I want a nice old comfortable father. I try to look after him, but he just won't settle down. I've got a problem, believe me, I've got a problem."" Stories relate incidents in Margie and Vern's lives as they attempt to resolve their respective problems. Margie and Vern live in Apartment lOA of the Carlton Arms Hotel in New York City. Vern is an investment counselor with the Manhattan firm of Honeywell and Todd. Mrs. Clarissa Odetts, their neighbor, lives in Apartment IOC, and Vern's romantic interest, Roberta Townsend, lives in Apartment lOB. Margie, who is described as ""pretty, shapely and attractive,"" appears to have no job. She uses her beauty to get men to do what she wants them to do. Margie loves to meddle in Vern's business (and private) affairs. When Margie does something, Vern finds out. Vern decides to get even and teach her a lesson. However, as Vern tries to teach Margie a lesson, she finds out and turns the tables and tries to teach him a lesson for trying to teach her a lesson (the basic plot of virtually every episode). Margie, who has Irish blood from her mother, is a talented dancer. Freddie Wilson is Margie's impoverished boyfriend. He seems permanently suited for unemployment, and, as Vern says, ""Freddie is the only man I know who got fired from five different jobs in the same week."" Despite the fact that Vern dislikes Freddie and calls him a ""droop,"" Margie loves him.Mrs. Odetts is Margie's elderly neighbor and her ""cohort in crime."" She is an 82-year-old, young at heart widow who had British ancestors at Valley Forge. Her lifelong ambition was to be an actress, and she finds pure delight in helping Margie turn the tables on Vern. George Honeywell is Vern's boss at the investment agency, and Charlie is the building elevator operator. Relatives: Lela Bliss Hayden (Freddie's mother), Harry Hayden (Freddie's father), Sheila James (Clarissa's granddaughter. Norma Jean Odetts), Crystal Reeves (Clarissa's sister.

 Mysteries of Chinatotvn. ,Series, Crime Drama, ABC," Yat Fu's is a curio shop at 1302 Golden Avenue in San Francisco's Chinatown. Dr. Yat Fu is its owner, an amateur crime sleuth who helps the police solve crimes. Ah Toy is his beautiful niece and shop assistant and sometimespartner in crime solving; she lives with her uncle at 0734 Magnolia Street. Dr. Yat Fu works closely with Lieutenant Hargrove of the S.F.PD.'s Homicide Bureau. When East Coast commitments forced Bill Eythe to leave the live West Coast-produced series, his Hargrove character was killed during ""a volley of slugs pouring out of a Chinatown alley."" He was replaced by Richard Crane as Lieutenant Cummings (when commitments called Crane away from the show, Cummings was not killed off; he was simply contacted by phone and not seen). Mysteries of Chinatown is a unique show for its time, as no expense was spared to make authentic sets. While shows like Captain Video had a weekly props budget of $25 in 1949, ""Mysteries"" spent more than $10,000 just to furnish the set. Some of the most notable props were a genuine teakwood tabaret valued at $3,000, a real Chinese sacred urn (so ornate it couldn't be replaced; valued at $1,500) and two genuine opium pipes, each over 155 years old. The program also employed four exterior sets and four interior sets (which cost many thousands of dollars and took one thousand man hours to build). Topping it off was $5,000 worth of theatrical lights to illuminate the eight sets. Cast: Marvin Miller {Dr. Yat Fu), Gloria Saunders {Ah Toy), Bill Eythe {Lt. Hargrove), Richard Crane {Lt. Cummings).

 Naked City. ,Series, Crime Drama, ABC," The program opens with these words spoken by the producer, Herbert B. Leonard: ""Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to see the Naked City. This story was not photographed in a studio; quite the contrary. The actors played out their roles in the streets and buildings of New York itself."" Naked City appeared as two separate series: a half-hour version (1958-1959) and an hour version (1960-1963). Eachversion was filmed in black and white and ftjcused on the grueling investigations of police ofiicers as they solved crimes. Jim Halloran and Dan Muldoon are detectives with the 65th Precinct in Manhattan. Jim is married to Janet and is the father of Evie. He wore badge number 41367 and lived at 39 West 64th Street. Dan, an older detective, played by the books; Jim was a bit more impulsive and, while he followed all the rules, was eager to apprehend suspects and solve a case. Dan was killed off in the episode ""Ten Cent Dreams"" (March 10, 1959) when his car blew up after hitting a gasoline truck during a high speed car chase. He was replaced by Mike Parker, a somewhat gruff lieutenant who now worked alongside Jim. Also assisting Jim and Mike was Sergeant Frank Arcaro. George Duning and Ned Washington composed the 1959 theme ""This Is the Naked City."" Lieutenant Mike Parker and Sergeant Frank Arcaro reprised their roles with Detective Adam Flint becoming their new partner in hour long episodes. Adam was born in the Bronx and lived at 166th Street and McClelland Avenue; he attended P.S. 11 near Yankee Stadium. He now lives in Manhattan at 393 West 48th Street, Apartment E. He is romantically involved with Libby Kingston, an actress who works at an unidentified television studio in Manhattan. Like the prior version, the series is a character study of people in trouble with the law. Before it became known by the initials N.Y.RD., P.D.N.Y.C. (Police Department of New York City) appears on police vehicles. Each episode ended with one of the most famous lines in television history: ""There are eight million stories in the Naked City.

Peabody has accomplished many things in his life as a business magnate, inventor, scientist, Nobel laureate, gourmand, and two-time Olympic medalist. Mr. Peabody becomes sad and lonely and decides to adopt his own human son. In an alley, he meets Sherman a dorky, bespectacled, red-haired boy. After saving Sherman from a group of bullies, Peabody discovers that Sherman is an orphan and decides to adopt him. After a court appearance and a talk with the President and the government, Peabody becomes Sherman\'s new guardian. Mr. Peabody tells Sherman to not call him ""Daddy"" and to call him by his name, ""Mr. Peabody"", or ""Peabody"". Believing that boys need running room, Peabody invents the WABAC machine as a birthday gift for Sherman. He and Sherman go back in time to see a Roman speaking in Latin; Peabody adds a translator circuit to the machine so that everyone seems to speak English. They see the Roman again and learn that he is a used chariot salesman. Their next trip is to see Ben Franklin flying his kite, but Peabody and Sherman discover that they cannot interact with the past. Peabody makes some more adjustments, turning the WABAC into a ""should-have-been machine"". This causes past events to seem distorted and anachronistic, and famous people to behave out of character. Each of the cartoons usually ends with a bad pun from Mr. Peabody to Sherman which resulted in a group sour notes played on a tuba, or a bass Trombone. Only if the pun was good was the distorted sound not heard.'

 Perry Mason. ,Series, Crime Drama, CBS," Perry Mason is a brilliant criminal attorney working out of Los Angeles. His retainer fees range from $1,000 to $5,000 and he works by the books _æ even when the odds are stacked up against his client. Perry refuses to plea bargain because he believes risking the life of his client is better than ruining it with a suspicious way out or a reduced sentence. While Perry is also competent as a detective, it is in the courtroom where his abilities become evident. He is shrewd and never lets it be known that at times he did not have sufficient evidence to defend a client (he always waits for that last minute piece of evidence to free a client). Delia Street is Perry's efficient, loyal secretary. She occasionally assists Perry in the field (often helps by donning various disguises) . Paul Drake is Perry's investigator; Hamilton Burger is the prosecuting attorney; Gertie Lade is Perry's receptionist; Margo is Drake's secretary; David Gideon is Perry's associate (later episodes) and Perry works with the following police officials: Lt. Arthur Tragg, Lt. Steve Drumm; Sergeant Brice and Lt. Andy Anderson. Based on characters created by Erie Stanley Gardner; 245 episodes were filmed (the last one in color).

 'Perry Mason is an attorney who specializes in defending seemingly indefensible cases.

 'In most episodes, the climactic courtroom scenes were not part of a trial, but a preliminary hearing (a proceeding in which the prosecution seeks to show that there is sufficient probable cause to bind the defendant over for trial).

Alas, Perry is still able to clear the defendant. Mason\'s most famous ""loss"" occurred in _""Perry Mason"" (1957) {The Case of the Deadly Verdict (#7.4)}_ (qv). The show uncharacteristically opens in the courtroom. A decision is being handed down. Perry\'s client is found guilty of murdering her aunt for money. To pump up interest in this particular case, which ran in October 1963, teasers were released to the press that in September, the official beginning of the 1963-64 season, Will Perry lose his biggest case ever? It also pointed out that the big question was, can ""Perry and his client . . . reverse the circumstances just before the final commercial"" They did.'

 Pete Kelly's Blues. ,Series, Crime Drama, NBC," ""The period was called the Roaring Twenties,"" says Pete Kelly, a cornet player and leader of a jazz band called the Big Seven. ""Americans were told they had to stop drinking but thirty million of them stayed thirsty and ate salted peanuts to make sure. It was an age of jazz music, speakeasies, rum running, bathtub gin, murder, reprisal and organized disorder. Everything was on sale _æ from wood alcohol to immortal souls _æ and down the street was a guy who would give a discount on either one. Those were the accents of 1927 and the music, it was jazz. From the start it had kind of an epileptic charm. It fitted the times but it was more than the times. It said more, it made jokes and it wept. It laughed out loud, it dosed and sometimes spoke with regret."" For Pete Kelly, it began in Chicago. As a kid he became fascinated with the cornet and set his goal on becoming a musician. In one episode, Pete mentions that musician Gus Trudeaux taught him how to play the cornet. They became friends but when Gus became involved with the mob, Pete left Chicago and headed for Kansas City, Missouri, the series setting. Later, Pete mentions he was a struggling musician who befriended Gus at a union meeting. He also befriended a piano player named Augie and he and Augie drifted to Kansas City where Pete later formed the Big Seven. Pete would like to do nothing else then play the cornet, but that was not meant to be as trouble seems to find him no matter where he goes. While not an official private detective, Pete becomes a somewhat unofficial source of law and order when he risks his life to help people in trouble. Pete and the Big Seven play regularly at Lupo's, a brownstone turned funeral parlor turned speakeasy at 17 Cherry Street. ""It's a standard speakeasy,"" says Pete. ""The booze is cut but the prices aren't. The beer is good and the whiskey is aged _æ if you get there later in the day. We play here from 10 P.M. to 4 A.M., with a pizza break at midnight. The hours are bad, but the music suits us. There's one other thing about 17 Cherry Street and that's trouble. You can get it by the yard, the pound, wholesale and retail."" George Lupo owns the speakeasy. ""He was theonly kid in Linback County who got turned down for reform school,"" says Pete. ""He later fought in the war with the 102nd Infantry and he pays scale _æ with a five dollar kickback."" Other regulars are Savannah Brown, Pete's friend, a singer at Fat Annie's, a speakeasy on the Kansas side (Annie says, ""It's easy to sing the blues _æ all you need to do is be born when there is rain on the roof"") and Johnny Cassiano, an officer with the Kansas City Police Department. Dick Cathcart is the off screen cornet player for Pete; the Matty Matlock Combo provides music for the club scenes. The program opens with these words: ""This one's about Pete Kelly. It's about the world he goes around in; it's about the big music, the big trouble and the big Twenties."" The program is based on the radio series of the same title (NBC, 1951) with Jack Webb as Pete Kelly and Jack Kruschen as George Lupo.

 Peter Gunn. ,Series, Crime Drama," NBC, ABC"," Peter Gunn is a former cop turned private detective who operates out of Los Angeles, California. He resides at 351 Ellis Park Road. His company is known as both Gunn Investigations and Peter Gunn's Private Detective Agency (established on July 5,1957). Peter Gunn is actually the first private detective created for television. Prior detectives, like Mike Hammer, Richard Diamond, Ellery Queen and Martin Kane, were all based on characters appearing in books, on the silver screen or on radio. Peter Gunn was a bit more sophisticated than his predecessors. He was always well dressed and more reserved and polished. He spoke more respectfully and frequented a classy hangout. However, like those before him, Gunn inherited a flare for violence _æ whether it was with his fists or gunplay. Mother's, a waterfront nightclub owned by a woman known only as Mother is the classy hangout Gunn chose to frequent the most although he was seen entering such dives as the Green Cafe, Nate's Hot Dogs and Cooky's, a beatnik coffee house. Edie Hart, the glamorous and sophisticated singer at Mother's, is Gunn's romantic interest. She lives at the Bartell Hotel, Apartment 15, at 1709 Ver Banna Street, and later became the club's owner; she changed the name to Edie's. Lieutenant Jacoby of the 13th Precinct of the L.A.PD. Homicide Squad, is Gunn's police department contact; Babby is one of Gunn's snitches, a diminutive pool hustler; he often tells Peter to ""think tall.""

The system showed brilliant color but played havoc with faces and hair, giving a two-tone look.

 'Quick Draw Mcgraw was a dimwitted and lanky mustang (horse) who caused much chaos in the Old West. If he could get his own six shooter out of his holster at all, he would usually shoot the wrong man. His partner, a Mexican burro name Baba Looie, was always trying to help Quick Draw as much as he could. Also on the show were cartoons featuring Snooper and Blabber, Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy.']","['Quick Draw\'s alter-ego, El Kabong, is a spoof of the then-popular TV-series _""Zorro"" (1957)_ (qv).'
 'All 45 of his cartoons that originally aired between 1959 and 1962 were written by Michael Maltese, known best for his work at the Warner Bros. cartoon studio.'
 'In the Spanish American version, Quick Draw (Tiro Loco McGraw) speaks in a very English-influenced accent, and Baba Looey (Pepe Trueno, or Pepe Luis in some episodes) speaks in a very Mexican accent, so it was clear that Quick Draw was the alien, and there was no need to adapt any feature of the story. In the Brazilian version, however, Quick Draw speaks in a drawling Portuguese which along with his hispanized name (Pepe Legal) would suggest he was either a Texan-American or Mexican cowboy.'
 'The cartoon was one of six TV shows to win an Emmy Award in 1960.'
 'Quick Draw satirized the westerns that were popular among the American public at the time. His character was well-intentioned, but somewhat dim.'
 'Quick Draw was himself a horse caricature who walked on two legs like a human (as did Baba Looey), and had ""hands"" that were hooves with thumbs and could hold objects such as guns. This did not stop the show\'s producers from depicting him riding into town on a realistic horse, or, as seen in the show\'s opening credits, driving a stagecoach pulled by a whole team of realistic horses. This aspect was made light of in the 1980s made-for-television film The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound, which featured Quick Draw.'
 'In the Spanish-dubbed version as El Kabong was called ""El Caba-Zorro"" or ""El Relámpago"".'
 ""Quick Draw McGraw occasionally appeared in other Hanna-Barbera productions including 1973's Yogi's Gang, 1977-1978's Laff-a-Lympics, a celebrity roast honoring Fred Flintstone on the TV special Hanna-Barbera's All-Star Comedy Ice Revue (1978) and the 1979 TV special Casper's First Christmas and in an episode from the short lived 1978 series Yogi's Space Race.""
 'On the cartoon\'s soundtrack, the ""kabong"" sound effect was produced by a foley artist striking the detuned open strings of a cheap acoustic guitar. (Without any of the obvious cartoon theatrics, this would also be reprised by several professional wrestlers, most notably Jeff Jarrett and The Honky Tonk Man, referred to then either under El Kabong\'s name or as the ""Acoustic Equalizer"").'
 'Quick Draw was the mascot for Sugar Smacks in the early 1960s.'
 'Quick Draw made a cameo in a MetLife commercial in 2012.'
 'There are references to ""El Kabong"" in the TV series The Critic - Jay Sherman\'s father, Franklin Sherman, imitates El Kabong, swooping from chandeliers dressed similar to Zorro and hitting people over the head with a guitar.'
 'In the professional wrestling world, the name ""El Kabong"" was used by then-Extreme Championship Wrestling commentator Joey Styles to describe when a popular ECW wrestler, New Jack, used an acoustic guitar as a weapon during a match. The act is also used by former World Wrestling Federation employee The Honky Tonk Man, former enhancement talent Quick Draw Rick McGraw and current Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Vice President and wrestler Jeff Jarrett.'
 'McFarlane Toys produced a figure of Quick Draw McGraw as El Kabong as part of their Hanna-Barbera toy line.'
 'Quick Draw McGraw is referred to in \'Busta Rhymes\' (qv)\' songs ""So Hardcore"" and ""Everything Remains Raw"". The relevant lines are ""Hardcore like Quick Draw McGraw / F*** what you heard you ain\'t heard this before.""'
 'Quick Draw McGraw is also referred to in MF Doom\'s Viktor Vaughn song Modern day Mugging in which an old lady is said to have ""pulled out and let off like Quick Draw McGraw"" \'Lil\' Wayne\' (qv) refers to Quick Draw McGraw in his song ""Fireman."" He orates: ""Been in that water since a youngin\', you just shark food / Quick Draw McGraw I went to art-school"".'
 '\'Lil\' Wayne\' (qv) also references Quick Draw McGraw in his song ""What\'s Wrong With Them?"" Weezy raps: ""Man I\'m fly as f-ck you ain\'t even next to depart / Quick Draw McGraw, I hope you like art.""'
 'Quick Draw McGraw is also referred to in House of Pain\'s song ""Boom Shalock Lock Boom (Butch Vig Mix)."" The song appeared on the EP, ""Shamrocks And Shenanigans."" The relevant lines are, ""I\'m quick on the draw / like the horse named McGraw / from the cartoon / Boom shalock lock boom.""'
 'The Game\'s ""One Blood (Remix)"" refers to Quick Draw McGraw. T.I. raps, ""I\'m prepared, in the mall and all with two tools. You can call me Quick Draw McGraw.""'
 ""Quick Draw's dog Snuffles made a special guest appearance on an episode of Johnny Bravo in which Johnny follows a woman who he mistakes for his mother. In the episode, Snuffles is assigned by the police to help find Johnny - provided, of course, he is given doggy snacks along the way.""
 'Quick Draw also appeared in the Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law episode ""Guitar Control"" voiced by Maurice LaMarche impersonating Charlton Heston. He appears as a defendant for being charged with carrying a concealed weapon (his guitar) when he was about to use it on some criminals as El Kabong.'

Red Ryder is assisted by Little Beaver, a Navaho Indian, and stories follow their efforts to maintain law and order. The series is based on the newspaper feature by Fred Harmon. Before the series aired, a pilot (unaired) was made in 1953 that also featured Lindy, the young girl who has a crush on Red Ryder; and Pigtales, the daughter of the town's newspaper editor. Red Ryder rides a horse named Thunder. Little Beaver, whose catchphrase is ""You betchum. Red Ryder,"" rides a horse called Papoose. Many early television pilots contained special pitches for sponsor endorsement that was not meant to be seen by the general public. If the pilot aired, these segments were replaced by commercials. Red Ryder contains a typical sales pitch that played before the closing theme. It begins with Red Ryder addressing the sponsor: ""Howdy Mr. Sponsor, this is where the commercial would normally come in. Since this is the first of our series, I'd like to take the time for you to meet my friends because they'll try to help sell your product just as sincerely as I will.

 Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. ,Series, Adventure, Syn.," Just as William Preston completes his college education in the United States, he receives word from Canada that his father has been killed in the Yukon by an evil criminal named Spike Wilson. The time is 1898, and to gain the legal authority to capture his father's killer, Preston joins the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Following rigorous training, he is made a constable and assigned to capture Spike Wilson. After months of hardship and privation, traveling through a wind-swept wilderness, Preston comes to the end of his trail _æ the camp of Spike Wilson. A fight ensues, but Preston manages to apprehend his enemy; Spike is tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. Shortly after, while on duty. Constable Prestonintervenes in a lynx attack and rescues a husky puppy that has been raised by a female wolf. He names the dog Yukon King and teaches it to lead a sled team, respect good men and hate evil ones. Months later, when Spike escapes from prison, Preston is again assigned to capture him. When he does, Preston is promoted to sergeant; Spike is sentenced to death. Stories, set in the early 1900s, relate Sergeant Preston's efforts to maintain law and order in the early Gold Rush days of the Yukon. In addition to his dog, Yukon King, Preston also has a horse named Rex. In early episodes, the Mountie headquarters is in the town of Dawson; later it is at Lake La Barge. Fred Foy did the announcing, and the Donna Diana Overture by Von Reznicek was used as the show's theme song.

Sergeant Preston of the Yukon is presented by Quaker Oaks, the cereal shot from guns.""

" Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. ",Series, Adventure, Syn.," A private plane flying over Africa develops engine trouble and crashes into the dense jungle. The pilot and two of the plane's three passengers are killed. The lone survivor, a young girl, is found by Logi, the noble chief of the Inoma tribe. Logi names the girl Sheena and raises her to respect good men and hate bad ones. The series begins when Sheena is 28 years old. She is blonde, five feet, nine inches tall and weighs 141 pounds. She measures 39-24-38 and wears a conservative but leg revealing leopard skin dress with a black waist belt that has a cloth attachment to hold her ivory horn (which she uses to summon the animals for help). Sheena also carries a spear and a knife. Sheena, called ""The White Jungle Goddess"" by superstitious natives, is assisted by her pet chimpanzee, Chim (played by Neil). Chim likes to fish and Sheena says that one day he is going to catch ""The Big One."" Sheena's friend. Bob Rayburn was originally depicted as a white trader and made Kenya his home (he bought supplies from the Evans Trading Post). As more unscrupulous characters invaded Africa, Rayburn was said to be a big game hunter who worked on behalf of the Commissioner to ensure the safety of people on safaris. He originally dressed in a black shirt and white pants and carried a knife and handgun; later, his dress is all white and he is armed with a rifle. Sheena prefers to ""move through the trees"" (swing by vine from one to another) rather than walking through the jungle (""Faster my way,"" she says). When Sheena leaves her horn behind it indicates to Bob that she is in trouble. Irish McCalla as Sheena is television's first female superhero. The character would not appear on television again for 44 years when Gena Lee Nolin be-came the jungle queen in a new series titled simply Sheena (see prior title). Anita Ekberg was originally cast (1955) to play Sheena but prior commitments forced her to back out by the time the very rare color pilot was shot (the series is in black and white). The program was filmed in Mexico (although set in Kenya, East Africa; an end credit reads ""Animal sequences filmed in Africa""). Irish McCalla originally performed her own stunts. When she injured an arm, her stunts (basically swinging on vines through the trees) were performed by Mexican acrobat Raul Gaona (a tall enough woman, apparently, could not be found). Stunt scenes with Gaona, dressed in a leopard skin and blonde wig, are shot from his back and at a sizeable distance (impossible to tell who it is). Irish's stunt sequences can be identified by the closeness of the action. Cast: Irish McCalla (Sheena), Christian Drake {Bob Ray burn), Lee Weaver (Logi). Theme Song: ""Sheena"" by Eli Brisken.

 Sherlock Holmes. ,Series, Crime Drama, Syn.," London, England, in 1897 is the setting. When John H. Watson, an army doctor stationed in Afghanistan, is wounded (shot in the shoulder), he is ordered to return home to England. While looking for a place to live, he runs into an old friend who tells him about ""a chap named Sherlock Holmes"" who is also seeking lodging. At the University Hospital, Watson first meets Sherlock Holmes. Holmes is working in a lab and tells Watson about a flat for rent at 221-B Baker Street (the first door up). ""We examined the rooms,"" Dr. Watson says, ""and we moved in the next day."" Sherlock Holmes is a consulting detective (he in-tervenes in baffling police matters), and Dr. Watson is his biographer (he writes of their experiences together and sells the stories to various magazines). Holmes has a lab in the flat and conducts experiments (for example, on beneficial aspects of poison) and has begun investigating such unknown sciences as fingerprints and ink smudges. He solves cases by observation and deduction and says, ""It is the little things that make the difference"" (the seemingly insignificant pieces of evidence). Holmes plays the violin to think (he also has a fascination for the piano); smokes a pipe; and keeps his canister of tea at the end of a line of bottles of poison on a shelf. He doesn't care who gets the credit for solving a crime, but he takes pride in hearing Watson say, ""Brilliant, Holmes, absolutely briUiant,"" after he solves a crime. Inspector Lestrade is with New Scotland Yard and likes his cases ""fast and simple."" He believes Sherlock's experiments are ""nonsense"" and is constantly amazed by Holmes's ability to solve a case using what he considers the insignificant. The series is based on the character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is also known as The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes. Theme: ""Sherlock Holmes,"" by Paul Durand.

Good old Buster Brown shoes are on the air out here in Hollywood for another good old Saturday hullabaloo."" Children of all ages were then led into a world where the unreal became real. The set resembled a clubhouse, and Ed began each show seated in a large easy chair. He opened a rather big book called Smilin Ed's Stories, and various filmed segments were shown (most often the serial-like adventures of ""Ghanga Rama, the Elephant Boy""; these tales, set in Bakore, India, told of Ghanga Rama and his friend, Charmer). Other segments were the antics of Midnight the Cat and Squeaky the Mouse (for example, Squeaky attempting to play ""Oh Susannah"" on his fiddle while Midnight accompanies him on a drum), Grandie the Talking Piano, the Buster Brown Jug Jingle (jingles sent in by viewers) and the most popular segment, Froggie the Gremlin, the mischievous, magical frog (a rubber toy that was eventually marketed). Standing next to a grandfather clock, Ed would say, ""Now Froggie, you better become visible. Plunk your magic twanger, Froggie"" (at which time Froggie would become visible and say ""Hi ya, kids, hi ya, hi ya, hi ya!""). After a brief conversation between Froggie and Smilin' Ed, the show's weekly guest star would come out (for example, Vito Scotti as Signor Pasta Fausuolo, the music teacher).

 Space Patrol. ,Series, Adventure, ABC," The Space Patrol is a 30th century organization that is responsible for the safety of the United Planets (Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Venus). The United Planets measure seven and one third billion miles in diameter. The Space Patrol is based on the manmade city of Terra and is not only responsible for protecting the United Planets from alien invaders, but keeping the space lanes safe for travel. Major ""Robbie"" Robertson is the Security Chief for the United Planets; Buzz Corry is the commander of the Space Patrol and its chief operative(tackling dangerous missions in the cause of universal freedom) . He is assisted by Cadet Happy, Tonga and Carol Carlisle. Buzz succeeded his brother, Kit Corry as the chief of the Space Patrol shortly after the series began. Buzz is fascinated by Carnacan history (a lost civilization of the planet Mars) and is quick to take action in any situation to save his shipmates. His first ship was the Battle Cruiser 100; this was replaced by the Terra IVznd finally the Terra V. Cadet Happy, the winner of the Corry Scholarship (set up by Buzz's family) is a recent graduate of the Space Patrol Academy and served as Buzz's co-pilot. He is easygoing, a bit inexperienced and always ready for a fight. His hobby is photography and ""holy smokin' rockets"" is his favorite saying (which he utters when something goes wrong). Tonga, a criminal before being reformed, is now a Space Patrol ally (she previously robbed passengers on sightseeing ships). She works as the assistant to the Security Chief (Major Robertson) and often joins Buzz and his associates on assignments (in some episodes Tonga is said to be the secretary to the Secretary of the United Planets). Carol is the daughter of the Security General of the United Planets. She is a brilliant scientist and inventor of the Agra-Ray, a device that brings plants to full maturity in a matter of hours; however, if used in reverse, the ray can turn cities into stone. Carol and Tonga, while supposed to be ""the weaker sex,"" were in no way depicted as such. While their uniforms were designed to show their legs for a bit of ""cheesecake,"" they were capable of defending themselves (but were most often depicted as ""girls in distress"" who needed rescuing by Buzz). Major Robertson was quick to act but often questioned his decisions and worried about the consequences of his actions. He also invented the formula for the Zeta Ray, a machine that cures any illness and halts the spread of infection. Prince Baccarratti, also known as the Black Falcon, is an evil alien, based in his castle on Planet X, who sought to rule the United Planets by destroying the Space Patrol. Mr. Proteus, the man of many faces, was also a threat to Buzz and his crew. Agent X and Major Sova were also enemies of the United Planets. Space Patrol premiered locally in Los Angeles on KECA-TV on March 13, 1950, as a 15-minute daily serial. This was followed by a 30-minute Saturday morning network series that ran from December 30, 1950 to February 26, 1955. Both were distributed to affiliated stations by kinescope. KECA dropped the daily shows from national distribution when the cost of film and shipping became excessive. The daily shows now aired only in Los Angeles while the Saturday morning shows were still being seen elsewhere (about a week later) by kinescope (making a copy of a live TV show by photographing it off a moni-tor). By late 1952, when the coaxial cable permitted coast-to-coast transmission, the live Saturday shows were no longer kinescoped; the daily series was dropped.

 Sugarfoot. ,Series, Western, ABC," ""Sugarfoot"" is a Western term for ""a cowboy who is working his way up to be a tenderfoot."" Tom Brewster is considered a Sugarfoot. He is peaceful, laidback, idealistic and romantic and looked upon as a gullible coward by the roughneck cowboys. Despite their belief, Tom is skilled with his gun, his fists and a knife. Tom was born in Oklahoma. When he was a child he was inspired by Judge Henry Davis (Harry Holcombe) to become a lawyer (the judge made decisions to help change the country; deciding, for example, that the Indian is a person as defined by the Constitution). He was a man who personified the law to Tom. When the series begins, Tom is a law school correspondence student who roams the West of the  1870s. He signed up ""for some of them correspondence courses from Kansas City"" (he is up to lesson seven in the pilot and carries the law book Blackstone's Commentary, volume 9). Tom plans to hang up his shingle in a place that needs him and which he needs. Tom calls guns ""tools of the devil."" He wears his father's gun and believes that ""shootin ain't always the answer."" He drinks sarsapariUa (""with a touch of cherry"") and carries a ""Home, Sweet Home"" plaque with him as he wanders from town to town ""tryin to earn a little livin' money."" While Tom struggled to avoid gunplay (he wanted only to study his law books), trouble was all that he found. His knowledge of the law and strong sense of justice helped him overcome difficult situations when defending clients. In the town of Casa Grande, Arizona, Tom meets Toothy Thompson, ""a man with a face people distrust."" When Tom gets Toothy acquitted of an attempted murder charge, he finds himself with a new friend and occasional companion on the trail. (Toothy, described as ""kinda spooky looking, always smilin',"" was so grateful for what Tom had done for him that he made himself Tom's best friend.) Will Hutchins also played his outlaw double, the Canary Kid, in several episodes. Cast: Will Hutchins (Tom Brewster), Jack Elam (Toothy Thompson).

" The $64,000 Question. ",Series, Game, CBS," Players, who possess knowledge in at least one specific field, compete. The player begins by answering one question, which is worth one dollar. Each additional question doubles the previous amount of money; however, an incorrect response defeats a player who loses everything he has won up to that point. When ten questions are correctly answered, the player reaches the first plateau of $512. The money is frozen and remains his. If the player answers the next three questions correctly, he reaches the second plateau of $4,000. For the remaining four plateaus ($8,000, $16,000, $32,000 and $64,000), the player is placed in an isolation booth and asked extremely difficult questions. A player's winnings are based on his success at each ofthese plateaus; or his decision to quit at a specific point and leave with what money he has already won. See also the extension series.

 '""The $64,000 Question"" was based on the old radio program, ""Take it or Leave It,"" which had a $64 top prize. Contestants who appeared on the show answered questions in one single category (e.g., Shakespeare, the Bible, American History or boxing). The first question was worth $64, and doubled as the questions increased in difficulty, up to that breathtakingly difficult $64,000 question. If the contestant reached the $1,000 plateau, the contestant returned to the next show to answer one question each week (the questions brought out by a bank executive and two security guards), so long as he/she kept winning. At the $4,000 plateau, he/she was placed in an on-stage isolation chamber; at the $8,000 plateau, any incorrect answer guaranteed the contestant a Cadillac Series 62 sedan as a consolation prize. At the $64,000, the contestant was given some reference material to study and/or could enlist the aid of an expert to help him/her answer the $64,000 question. The category for the first $64,000 winner, Capt. Tom McCutcheon, was in cooking; the second $64,000 winner was Dr. Joyce Brothers, whose expertise was in boxing. ""The $64,000 Question"" was among the most watched shows in all of television between 1955 and 1957, but its popularity would deteriorate rapidly in the face of the Quiz Show Scandals.

 The Abbott and Costello Show. ,Series, Comedy, Syn.," The Fields Rooming House at 214 Brookline Avenue in Hollywood, California, is owned by Sidney Fields, a patient and understanding man who tries to run ""a nice, quiet and decent"" establishment. He tries but the tenants complain about ""those two hoodlums you have living here."" Those ""hoodlums"" are Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, out of work actors who are struggling to survive on what jobs they can find (or more aptly put, what jobs Bud can find for Lou).Lou was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and mentioned that he helps support his sister and three nieces. Bud, who gets the hiccups when he's nervous, mentioned that he was a professional loafer (one who makes bread; not, as Lou believes, one who gets paid for doing nothing). Lou was also a Junior G-Man (a graduate of a through-the-mails detective school) and carried a toy cap pistol around with him for protection. ""We've got to raise some money"" is often said by Bud, as he and Lou are always behind in their seven dollar a week rent and finding work becomes a priority. (When they can't find work they sell what little valuables they have at Hock Shop Harry's.) Bud and Lou did have a number of jobs throughout the series run. These mostly one-day employment opportunities included being waiters at Brodie's Sea Food Restaurant; wallpaper hangers; pest exterminators; pet store owners; delivery boys for the Susquehanna Hat Company on Fluegel Street and soda jerks. When there is a situation that involves a friend (or stranger) who is in trouble, Bud always remarks ""Costello will get you out of this."" Bud and Lou also tried their hand at becoming cops by attending police rookie school. While the rules of the rooming house are quite strict (""no cooking cabbage in the apartment; no door slamming; no loud radio playing after 9:30; no pets; no babies"") Lou most often breaks the no-pet rule with Bingo the Chimp, a chimpanzee he adopted while working in the pet shop. Bingo dresses like Lou (trademark checkered jacket and gray hat). The six-year-old Bingo and Lou argue each night over who is going to take their bath first. Lou mentioned that Bingo's mother was working with a circus and his father was in the Belgian Congo. When Bud and Lou are out of town, Lou's girlfriend, Hillary Brooke, baby sits for Bingo. Hillary, a gorgeous blonde, held jobs in accordance with what the episode called for (for example, nurse, dental assistant, waitress, lawyer's office receptionist, owner of the B-Bar-B Ranch in Texas, and owner of a haunted castle at Goblins Knob, which she inherited from her Uncle Montague). When Hillary calls on Lou she brings him cream puffs. 3While Sidney Fields was primarily the landlord, he also played a number of relatives who were supposed tops in their fields (for example, Professor Melonhead, the judo expert; Lawyer Claude Melonhead; Judge Melonhead). Mike Kelly is the neighborhood police officer called ""Mike the Cop""; Stinky Davis is Lou's friend, a 30-year-old ""kid"" who loves to play games like football and hopscotch with Lou; Mr. Botchagalupe is the neighborhood's enterprising street vendor (seen selling fruit, vegetables, ice cream _æ whatever the episode called for). The song ""The Jazz Babies Ball"" is used as the show's second season theme (over which a montage of Bud and Lou's movie clips is seen). Cast: Bud Abbott (Himself), Lou Costello (Himself), Hillary Brooke (Herself), Sidney Fields (Himself), Gordon Jones (Mike the Cop), Joe Besser (Stinky), Joe Kirk (Mr. Botchagalupe).

Stuntmen were used for the more potentially dangerous stunts--being knocked through walls, getting hit by cars, etc.--but most of the falls you see Costello take were actually done by him.

 ""Sapphire's mother (Kingfish's mother-in-law) and Madame Queen were played by real-life sisters and veteran actresses 'Amanda Randolph' (qv) and 'Lillian Randolph' (qv). The Randolphs played their same roles on the original radio show.""
 'In order to assemble their dream cast, the producers enticed veteran performers \'Tim Moore (I)\' (qv) (George ""Kingfish"" Stevens) and \'Spencer Williams (VI)\' (qv) (Andrew Brown) with very lucrative (for the time) offers, as both had already retired after long careers in show business.'
 ""For more than two decades, the voices of Amos, Andy and the others (performed on radio by white actors 'Freeman F. Gosden' (qv) and 'Charles J. Correll' (qv)) had become familiar to a large segment of the American public. In choosing actors for this television version, they wanted to find competent actors whose voices sounded close to the already famous character voices from radio. 'Alvin Childress' (qv)'s natural voice sounded very close to Freeman Gosden's Amos, 'Spencer Williams (VI)' (qv) sounded, and even looked, like Charles J. Correll's Andy. 'Tim Moore (I)' (qv) was able to duplicate the vocal performance of Kingfish (also done on radio by Freeman Gosden).""
 'After the show was canceled with 65 episodes, CBS wanted to syndicate the reruns but felt that they needed more shows. The cast was brought back to film an additional 13 episodes to premiere in syndication. These episodes were originally to be titled ""The Adventures of Kingfish"" but premiered with the ""Amos \'n Andy"" rerun package instead.'
 'The NAACP was so outraged by what it considered extremely negative stereotypical portrayal of black people in ""The Amos \'n Andy Show,"" that it fought with CBS almost immediately upon the show\'s TV premiere in June 1951 to get the show off the air. They finally succeeded in 1966, when the show was removed from syndication. No episode of ""Amos \'n Andy"" has been aired on television since that time. The only viewing of any portion of the show since its removal from the airwaves were the clips from various episodes included in the documentary _Amos \'n\' Andy: Anatomy of a Controversy (1983) (TV)_ (qv).'

 The Betty Hutton Show. ,Series, Comedy, CBS," Goldie Appleby is a former vivacious showgirl turned manicurist. She lives with her two best friends, Lorna Peterson and Rosemary Zandt in Apartment ISA at 346 West 4lst Street in Manhattan. One day, Goldie accepts a dinner invitation from a lonely but wealthy customer named Mr. Strickland (David White). Later that night, Strickland's sudden death makes her the beneficiary of his will, the head of the $60 million Strickland estate and guardian of his three orphaned children: Patricia, Nicky and Roy. Goldie relinquishes her job and her apartment and moves to the Strickland duplex on Park Avenue to become the children's guardian. Stories follow Goldie's misadventures as she struggles to run the foundation and care for and secure the affections of the spendthrift Strickland children. As middle child Roy put it, Goldie was ""buttons and bows"" when she first arrived. She refined her wardrobe and her style; she is now ""wow"" according to Roy. Roy, as Goldie says, ""is the Adolphe Menjou of the grade school set."" He is the intellectual of the family, always dressed in a suit, very well mannered, and he seems more like a distinguished gentleman of 50 rather than a boy of 12. Goldie and Roy are close and, despite their age difference, Goldie turns to Roy for help and advice. Patricia, who attends the Blair Academy for Girls, is the oldest child (17) and is struggling to become part of the society circle that members of her family are meant to be associated with; Nicky, the youngest, is not as refined as Roy or as enthusiastic as Patricia about his role in society. He would like to be what he is, a little boy, and enjoy the things little boys enjoy (although he requires his father's money to fulfill those wishes). A second storyline follows Goldie's misadventures with Lorna and Rosemary. Rosemary works at the Pelican Club in Manhattan; Lorna is a beautician at the Mid Manhattan Salon. While the girls are the best of friends, they constantly bicker (as Goldie says, ""Why do they keep Indians on reservations and let nuts like you run around loose?"").

 Love That Bob. ,Series, Comedy," NBC, CBS"," The name on the office door reads ""Bob Collins _æ Photography."" Robert (""Bob"") Collins, a swinging young bachelor, is owner of the downtown Hollywood studio. Bob lives with his widowed sister, Margaret MacDonald, and her teenage son, Charles (""Chuck"") MacDonald, at 804 Grummond Road. Bob was born in Joplin, Missouri, and is descended from Scottish ancestors. He served in the air force during World War IL Bob is simply a suave and sophisticated ladies' man whose job is to photograph the world's most beautiful women. He considers his models ""lumps of clay. I mold them into bright, shimmering butterflies. I give them grace, style and charm."" Bob shoots fashion layouts for various magazines. He can make girls swoon, and he desperately seeks to avoid the path to matrimony. His worst month is June _æ when girls are the most marriage-minded and he finds it extremely difficult to remain a bachelor. Bob says he is married _æ to his camera: ""Any other type of marriage is a serious commitment and 1 need my time before settling down. I need to find the right person _æ no matter how many girls I have to date to find her."" ""Margaret is young and attractive,"" Bob says. ""I keep telling her she should get married again, but does she listen to me? No."" Margaret takes care of thehouse, cooks, cleans, does the shopping and manages to find a little romance _æ but despite what Bob thinks is best for her, she is not ready to settle down again. (Her longest romance was with Paul Fonda, Bob's World War II air force buddy. Paul is now an airline pilot [a captain] and married one of his stewardesses, Betty Havilland [Dorothy Johnson] .) Margaret considers Bob a father for Chuck: ""He's a kind man. He lets us share his house and is putting Chuck through school."" But Margaret also says, ""Chuck has been raised in an atmosphere of girls, girls, girls."" This has been a delight for Chuck, who hopes that whatever his Uncle Bob has, it can be inherited by a nephew. Chuck first attended Hollywood High School (where he was on the R.O.T.C. drill team). He joined the National Guard after graduation and in last season episodes enrolled in Gridley College (majoring in premed). Francine Williams was Chuck's original girlfriend; Carol Henning replaced her in last season episodes (she enrolled in nearby Beaumont College). ""When Bob decides to get married, there is someone waiting for him _æ me,"" says Charmaine Schultz, better known as Schultzy, Bob's plain-looking girl Friday. Schultzy is totally dedicated to Bob and in love with him _æ ""I can't compete with the models on the sofa, but give me the kitchen and food and I'll land him."" Bob has found the perfect assistant in Schultzy (who calls him ""Boss""). Bob says. ""Before Schultzy, I would train girls only to lose them to marriage."" The hours may be long at times, but Bob rarely complains when it comes to photographing his beautiful models. The voluptuous blonde bombshell, Shirley Swanson, is the model dead set on marrying Bob. Shirley, who measures 38-26-36, is very jealous and called the ""Wild Flower"" by Bob (Schultzy calls her ""Blondie""). Other recurring models included CoUette DuBois, a French knockout Bob called his ""Sly Little Thief""; Marie DiPaolo is an Italian model Bob calls ""My Little Venutian Ambassador of Loveliness."" She calls him ""Roberto""; Mary Beth Hall and Ingrid are two additional models who worked for and drove Bob crazy. Bob, like his father, is a photographer; but before them there was and still is ""Josh Collins _æ Photography,"" a business run by Bob's elderly but young at heart grandfather, Joshua (""Josh"") Collins, in Joplin, Missouri. Grandpa Collins (Bob Cummings in a dual role) lives in a drafty old house his father built (and died in from pneumonia). He calls Bob ""Young Rooster,"" Chuck ""Chuckle Boy"" and Margaret ""Mag Pie."" Other Roles: Harvey Helm is Bob's friend, a henpecked wholesale furniture salesman for the Gravener Furniture Company. He calls Bob ""BobbyBoy"" and was his co-pilot during the war. ""Harvey brings home the bacon, but his wife decides how to sHce it,"" says Bob. Harvey is married to Ruthie, a former swimsuit model of Bob's. Carol, Chuck's girlfriend, is Ruthie's niece. Pamela Livingston is Bob's friend, a member of the Bird Watchers' Society. Frank Crenshaw is the sailor with a crush on Schultzy. Kay Michael is the actress Bob dated. Martha Randolph is Schultzy's husband-hunting friend. Relatives: Tammy Marihugh (Bob's niece.

The Gold Rush days of old San Francisco are the setting (from 1849 to 1854 for the series). The call of ""there's gold in them thar hills"" brought both the honest prospectors and pioneers and a group of corrupt Australians who managed to gain control of the city. One such pioneer was Dion Patrick, a crusading newspaper editor (of the California Star) who established the Vigilante Committee of San Francisco as a means to uphold law and order. After 22 episodes, Dion Patrick was written out and replaced by Matt Wayne, a gentleman from Philadelphia who opens a gambling hall and is later elected marshal by the townspeople. When the second season began (episode 38, ""Dishonor for Matt Wayne""), Matt relinquishes his gambling hall to become a full time law enforcer (the idea of a marshal who owned a gambling hall bothered the city fathers).

This series aired on the DuMont Television Network, which operated from 1946 to 1956. In 1996, Edie Adams, a singer and actress, testified at a hearing in front of a panel of the Library of Congress on the preservation of American television and video. She stated that any kinescope recordings the network had kept were destroyed in the 1970s.

 ""On the radio series, 'Elvia Allman' (qv) played Gracie's best friend, Tootsie Sagwell, an overweight and unattractive frump whom Gracie was endlessly on a quest to find a husband for.

 ""'Gracie Allen' (qv) chose her own wardrobe.""
 ""Because 'Gracie Allen' (qv) had an abundance of illogical dialogue to deliver in every episode, she had difficulty memorizing the scripts. At times, cue cards were tacked onto the backs of props or hidden just out of camera range.""

Several different actors portrayed Blanche\'s husband Harry.'
 'In the final two seasons, many jokes revolved around George\'s ""magic television"" which allowed him to spy on friends and family members.

 ""When 'Larry Keating (I)' (qv) took over the role of Harry Morton, the writers completely overhauled the character to suit the dramatic actor. His occupation changed from real estate to accounting; he was no longer an overeater, instead opting for health food in an era when it was uncommon; and he was often described as a human thesaurus, spouting off eloquent rants filled with obscure words and phrases.""
 '\'George Burns (I)\' (qv) is regarded as being the first entertainer to step out of character and ""break the fourth wall"" by directly addressing the television audience. On many occasions, Burns stated he had been inspired by \'Thornton Wilder\' (qv)\'s 1938 play ""Our Town,"" though prior to that Burns had employed the same tactic in his first short film, _Lambchops (1929)_ (qv).'
 'In real life, star \'Harry von Zell\' (qv) had written several episodes of _""Wagon Train"" (1957)_ (qv), so the writers decided to capitalize on this throughout the final season in which Harry\'s TV persona was endlessly pitching George ideas for western-themed shows.'
 ""Although the sets went through drastic changes, the Burns' house was always located at 312 Maple Drive in Beverly Hills, California. The real-life Burns estate (sometimes utilized for exterior shots) is located at 720 N. Maple Drive.""
 'There are conflicting stories regarding \'Fred Clark (I)\' (qv)\'s departure from the show. On-screen, \'George Burns (I)\' (qv) explained that Clark had taken a role in a play and was unable to juggle both jobs. In ""Say Goodnight, Gracie! The Story of George Burns and Gracie Allen,"" the authors stated that his wife, singer \'Benay Venuta\' (qv) resided in New York, and the strain of commuting from Hollywood on weekends to be with her proved overwhelming. In his third autobiography, Burns wrote that Clark was contractually obligated for one additional season but demanded an additional $500 a week (which would have been more than Burns was making), so he was let out of his contract.'
 'Several people filed lawsuits because they shared names with the fictional characters on the show. The writers then began using ""safe"" names of crew members and their families for various characters to avoid further legal implications.'
 '\'Gracie Allen\' (qv) wanted to retire from show business in the 1940\'s and was reluctant to branch out into television, but husband \'George Burns (I)\' (qv) coerced her into it. Gracie decided she\'d had enough of TV by the fifth season and was furious that George kept going behind her back and signing contracts for additional seasons. During the eighth season, Gracie put her foot down and demanded she be allowed to retire. George retained the cast of characters for his short-lived spin-off, _""The George Burns Show"" (1958)_ (qv), with hopes that Gracie would change her mind and return to the show, but she didn\'t.'
 ""During the second season, 'George Burns (I)' (qv) realized it would be more practical to shoot the show on film rather than broadcast live. CBS wouldn't increase the budget to accommodate this extravagance, so Burns invested his own funds and founded McCadden Productions, a company through which he produced this series and many other television projects in the 1950s-'60s.""
 ""Harry Morton's full name is Harry Hugh Morton Jr.""
 ""Blanche Morton's maiden name is Baker.""
 ""Blanche and Harry Morton's preferred drink is Blackberry Cordial.""
 ""In the scripts, 'George Burns (I)' (qv) lines were typed in an extra large font so he could see them at a glance.""
 'George, Gracie and their radio staff resided in California, but the majority of TV shows originated in New York in the 1950s, so they were forced to begin the show there. The first six episodes were broadcast live from The Mansfield Theater in New York City with the staff headquartered at The Algonquin Hotel.

 The George Bums and Grade Allen Show. ,Series, Comedy, CBS," ""I'm George Burns, Gracie Allen's husband. I'm a straight man"" _æ these were the first words George spoke to introduce his first television series to viewers. Gracie is a comedienne and scatterbrained. She has a knack for confusing people and complicating the simplest situations. George is level-headed and knows that if it weren't for Grade's antics, ""I'd still be selling ties."" George and Gracie live at 312 Maple Street in Beverly Hills, California, with their son, Ronnie. George and Gracie met while performing in vaudeville in the 1920s. When George first dated Gracie, he gave her flowers. They married, according to Gracie, due to the meat shortage. (Gracie had invited George over for dinner one night in 1927. When Grade's mother had only enough steaks to feed four of the six people waiting for dinner, she told Gracie to elope _æ and so she and George did.) They were married in Cleveland, and George's friend. Jack Benny, was the witness.George and Gracie first lived at the Edison Hotel in New York City for three years before buying their home in California. George is a member of the Friars' Club and is famous for ""The Pause"" that he developed after Grade's response to one of his questions. George tries to discourage salesmen from coming to the house: ""You heard of the play Death of a Salesman^ Well, trying to sell Gracie something is what killed him."" Gracie believes that her father is younger than her husband (""I met my husband when he was 30; I first saw my father when he was 24""). When George and Gracie go to the movies, they sometimes have to sit through the film twice (""Gracie wants the movie and her popcorn to end at the same time""). George and Grade's neighbors, Blanche and Harry Morton, live at 314 Maple Street. Blanche grew up on Elm Street in Seattle; Harry, a CPA, went to Dartmouth and will drink only one alcoholic beverage _æ blackberry cordial. Before Larry Keating played Harry, Hal March, John Brown, Bob Sweeney and Fred Clark played the role. Harry was first an insurance salesman, then a real estate salesman and finally an accountant. Bill Goodwin, a ladies' man, was George's first announcer; he was replaced by Harry Von Zell, who frequently found himself the pawn in George's efforts to resolve problems arising from Grade's antics. Ronnie attends UCLA in later episodes; Bonnie Sue McAfee is his girlfriend; and Ralph Grainger is his best friend. Many of the episodes in syndication include references to the show's longtime sponsor. Carnation Milk (cans can be seen in kitchen shots, and Gracie was confused by the product _æ ""How do they get milk from carnations?""). When Gracie retired from show business in 1958, the series continued on NBC as ""The George Burns Show"" (10/21/58 to 4/14/59), with George playing himself as a theatrical producer. Ronnie Burns, Bea Benaderet, Larry Keating and Harry Von Zell continued their roles from the earlier series. See entry for additional information. Relatives: Mamie Kelly, Grade's married sister; Jeri and Jill, Mamie's daughters; Harry Morton, Sr., Harry's father; Roger, Blanche's brother; Linda, Blanche's niece. Ralph is Ronnie's friend; Imogene and Bonnie Sue are Ronnie's girlfriends; Mr. Beasley is the mailman; Chester Vanderlip is the bank president; Lucille is his wife; Emily is his daughter; Edie is the 11-year-old president of the Ronnie Burns Fan Club.

The stamp honoring ""The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show"" has a picture of stars \'George Burns (I)\' (qv) and \'Gracie Allen\' (qv).'
 'The bulk of the filmed episodes were shot over the course of a day with two cameras. Episodes were then edited and screened for a preview audience, and audio of the crowd\'s reaction was recorded to give an organic reaction to each joke rather than ""canned laughter."" At the end of each preview screening, George and Gracie would come out and film their ""Say goodnight, Gracie"" closing tag scene live in front of the audience.'
 'Countless times throughout the run of the series, \'George Burns (I)\' (qv) began singing a song which opened, ""I\'d love to call you Rose, dear, but roses fade away,"" and the running gag was that he was never able to finish. The song is titled ""I\'ll Buy the Ring (and Change Your Name to Mine),"" and Burns later issued a recording of it on his album ""George Burns Sings.""'
 ""The television series was adapted from Burns' & Allen's long-running radio show. The theme song, characters and many of the supporting actors made the transition.""
 'In the earlier radio series, \'Mel Blanc\' (qv) frequently guest-starred as Mr. Postman. \'Rolfe Sedan\' (qv) took over the role on TV, and the character was given the name Mr. Beasley. Mr. Beasley is also the name of the mailman from the ""Blondie"" comics and films, and the characters share a similarity - in ""Blondie,"" Mr. Beasley tried desperately to avoid Dagwood Bumstead, who was always plowing over him on his way out of the house; the ""Burns & Allen"" character went out of his way to avoid Gracie Allen, who would always detain him to talk his ear off.'
 'During the first two seasons, the show was performed live biweekly. Beginning in the third season, the show was committed to film weekly. Numerous scripts from the live seasons were tweaked and remade.'
 ""On the radio series, 'Elvia Allman' (qv) played Gracie's best friend, Tootsie Sagwell, an overweight and unattractive frump whom Gracie was endlessly on a quest to find a husband for. Allman didn't physically resemble the character she portrayed, so this character was omitted from the TV series and Allman was cast in the small recurring role of Jane, Gracie's costumer.""
 ""Establishing shots of George and Gracie's real-life home were utilized in the show.""

 ""Although 'Gracie Allen' (qv) was frequently seen rolling cigarettes on the show, in reality she was a non-smoker.""
 ""'Gracie Allen' (qv) chose her own wardrobe.""
 ""Because 'Gracie Allen' (qv) had an abundance of illogical dialogue to deliver in every episode, she had difficulty memorizing the scripts. At times, cue cards were tacked onto the backs of props or hidden just out of camera range.""

 ""'George Burns (I)' (qv) and 'Gracie Allen' (qv) encouraged their children 'Sandra Burns (I)' (qv) and 'Ronnie Burns (I)' (qv) to go into acting. Neither of the kids had aspirations to act, but both appeared in bit parts on the show as a courtesy to their parents. After 'Ricky Nelson (I)' (qv) became a sensation on his parents' TV series, George convinced Ronnie to join the show as a regular cast member in hopes that it would boost ratings and launch a career for his son.""
 ""'Gracie Allen' (qv) was frequently seen in the kitchen preparing meals, and she endorsed a vast array of baking products. In real life, Gracie didn't cook; meals were either made by the family's chef or they ate out.""
 ""'Gracie Allen' (qv) donned aprons in the kitchen as a tribute to her real-life Aunt Clara, whom she often told outrageous fictionalized tales about on the show.""
 'When the series went off the air in 1958, it was the longest-running situation comedy in television history.'

 '\'Bea \'Benadaret\' originated the role of neighbor Blanche Morton on the radio show in the 1940s and continued playing it for nine years on television in both this series and its short-lived spin-off _""The George Burns Show"" (1958)_ (qv). Several different actors portrayed Blanche\'s husband Harry.'
 'In the final two seasons, many jokes revolved around George\'s ""magic television"" which allowed him to spy on friends and family members. When Burns proposed the plot device, the sponsors told him it was unrealistic and threatened to drop the show, but Burns stood his ground and later joked that he\'d invented closed-circuit surveillance television.'
 ""During the eight years that the show was on the air, 'Gracie Allen' (qv) never appeared in the same outfit twice, and she had as many as three costume changes in some episodes.""
 'For their ""afterpiece"" vaudeville routines that closed the show in later seasons, George and Gracie emerged from a set of curtains plastered with the names of the various cities and theaters where the duo performed during their vaudeville days.'
 '\'Bea Benaderet\' (qv)\'s last name is credited as ""Benadaret"" (with two ""A""s) on this series. During the first show the misspelling was a typo, but Bea superstitiously decided to retain the spelling for luck. In a few subsequent episodes, another blunder was made with the misspelling of her first name as ""Bee.""'
 ""'Hal March' (qv) originally portrayed Harry Morton, but he quickly departed when he was offered another show. March later returned for guest spots including the recurring role of Harry Morton's lecherous real estate partner, Casey.""
 ""Following 'Hal March' (qv)'s quick departure after 7 episodes, the role of Harry Morton was given to 'John Brown (I)' (qv), who only appeared in 10 episodes before his name wound up on a Communist blacklist and the network was forced to let him go.""
 ""When 'Fred Clark (I)' (qv) landed the role of Harry Morton, the writers decided to give the character a voracious appetite. Clark's Harry was always munching on food, talking about food and hiding it in light fixtures, the fireplace and other odd locations to ensure his wife wouldn't prevent him from eating.""
 ""When 'Larry Keating (I)' (qv) took over the role of Harry Morton, the writers completely overhauled the character to suit the dramatic actor. His occupation changed from real estate to accounting; he was no longer an overeater, instead opting for health food in an era when it was uncommon; and he was often described as a human thesaurus, spouting off eloquent rants filled with obscure words and phrases.""
 '\'George Burns (I)\' (qv) is regarded as being the first entertainer to step out of character and ""break the fourth wall"" by directly addressing the television audience. On many occasions, Burns stated he had been inspired by \'Thornton Wilder\' (qv)\'s 1938 play ""Our Town,"" though prior to that Burns had employed the same tactic in his first short film, _Lambchops (1929)_ (qv).'
 'In real life, star \'Harry von Zell\' (qv) had written several episodes of _""Wagon Train"" (1957)_ (qv), so the writers decided to capitalize on this throughout the final season in which Harry\'s TV persona was endlessly pitching George ideas for western-themed shows.'
 ""Although the sets went through drastic changes, the Burns' house was always located at 312 Maple Drive in Beverly Hills, California. The real-life Burns estate (sometimes utilized for exterior shots) is located at 720 N. Maple Drive.""
 'There are conflicting stories regarding \'Fred Clark (I)\' (qv)\'s departure from the show. On-screen, \'George Burns (I)\' (qv) explained that Clark had taken a role in a play and was unable to juggle both jobs. In ""Say Goodnight, Gracie! The Story of George Burns and Gracie Allen,"" the authors stated that his wife, singer \'Benay Venuta\' (qv) resided in New York, and the strain of commuting from Hollywood on weekends to be with her proved overwhelming. In his third autobiography, Burns wrote that Clark was contractually obligated for one additional season but demanded an additional $500 a week (which would have been more than Burns was making), so he was let out of his contract.'
 'Several people filed lawsuits because they shared names with the fictional characters on the show. The writers then began using ""safe"" names of crew members and their families for various characters to avoid further legal implications.'
 '\'Gracie Allen\' (qv) wanted to retire from show business in the 1940\'s and was reluctant to branch out into television, but husband \'George Burns (I)\' (qv) coerced her into it. Gracie decided she\'d had enough of TV by the fifth season and was furious that George kept going behind her back and signing contracts for additional seasons. During the eighth season, Gracie put her foot down and demanded she be allowed to retire. George retained the cast of characters for his short-lived spin-off, _""The George Burns Show"" (1958)_ (qv), with hopes that Gracie would change her mind and return to the show, but she didn\'t.'
 ""During the second season, 'George Burns (I)' (qv) realized it would be more practical to shoot the show on film rather than broadcast live. CBS wouldn't increase the budget to accommodate this extravagance, so Burns invested his own funds and founded McCadden Productions, a company through which he produced this series and many other television projects in the 1950s-'60s.""

 ""Blanche Morton's maiden name is Baker.""
 ""Blanche and Harry Morton's preferred drink is Blackberry Cordial.""

 'George, Gracie and their radio staff resided in California, but the majority of TV shows originated in New York in the 1950s, so they were forced to begin the show there.

 'Guiding Light takes place in the fictional Midwestern town of Springfield. In its early years the stories centered on the middle class Bauer family, but later the wealthy Spauldings, Chamberlains, and Lewises, along with the working class Reardons and others, took their own places of prominence, though the Bauers remained the heart of the show.'
 '""The Guiding Light"" got it\'s start on radio in 1937 centering around the Church of Little Five Points in Illinois. The widowed Reverend John Ruthledge administered at the church and the guiding light referred to a lamp he had in his study that always remained lit for his parishioners and anyone to seek comfort at the non-denominational church. In the late 1940\'s, the show (still on radio) moved to the fictional suburb of Los Angeles, CA, Selby Flats when Rev. Ruthledge\'s daughter, Mary and her husband Ned Holden (who at one time was Rev. Ruthledge\'s adopted son) took the ""guiding light"" lamp to Rev. Ruthledge\'s friend and former protégé, Rev. Charles Matthews. In Selby Flats, the story of ""The Guiding Light"" started involving and centering on the continuing traumatic and dramatic stories of Meta Bauer White Roberts Banning and her stepdaughter Kathy Roberts Grant (and later her Kathy\'s daughter, Robin Fletcher) and also the lives of the rich Grants, the poorer Bauers (Papa, Bert Miller Bauer and Bill Bauer and Bert and Bill\'s sons, Mike and Ed) and the well off Fletchers. In the late 1960\'s the show started becoming more about Bert, Bill and Mike and Ed and their travails as Meta moved with her third husband Dr. Bruce Banning (Meta would return in the 70\'s for a brief time and then in the late 1990\'s.) The show premiered on TV in black & white and live (until 1969) on June 30, 1952. The local moved to the Midwestern town of Springfield in 1966 and stayed there until this day. In the 1967 the show was first aired in color, then it moved to a half-hour and on November 7, 1977 it became and hour show and introduced the Spaulding family -- who are mainstays of Springfield to this day. The ""The"" of ""Guiding Light"" was dropped about a year before it went to an hour. Other families introduced in the 1970\'s were the Norrises, the Thorpes (Roger was a major villain for over three decades), the Marlers (attorney Ross {who represented and defended Roger in the first ever marital rape storyline in 1979 -- Roger\'s then third wife, Holly had brought him up on the real charges -- the rape was shown on screen on March 4, 1979} has survived to this day, Jerry very Dorn has been on consistently since March 1979) and the Stapletons. In the 1980\'s the poorer Reardons, the wealthy Chamberlains and the middle class Lewises took over as major families as the Norrises, the Thorpes and the Stapletons all but disappeared (the Thorpes did make a return in 1989.) In the 1990\'s as the Reardons and then the Chamberlains seemed to leave the town of Springfield major families introduced were the poorer Coopers, and later in the 90\'s the mob family known as the Santoses. Also in the 1980\'s and 1990\'s into today, Josh Lewis and his longtime love interest Reva Shayne and their brood of Marah and Shayne -- as well as her sister Cassie Layne and her daughter Tammy became more mainstay. Besides a still undercurrent of a non-denominational religious theme, ""Guiding Light\'s"" main themes have been about how to find and keep and hold on to love (it\'s main theme in the early 1990\'s was a song entitled ""Hold On to Love"") and finding others to help guide you.']","['Guiding Light was the longest-running drama series in history. It began on radio, as ""The Guiding Light"", on January 25, 1937, and originally revolved around Rev. Dr. John Ruthledge (played by Arthur Peterson) and his congregation. CBS canceled it in 1939, 1941, 1942, 1944, and 1946. Each time, letter-writing campaigns led to the show\'s return.

Life at Ivy College, located in the town of Ivy, U.S.A., as seen through the eyes of Dr. William Todhunter Hall, the college president, and his wife, Vickie, a former London stage star. William was originally a student at Ivy. When he graduated and became an instructor, he lived in the boardinghouse across the street from Faculty Row. It was when William became a full professor that his life changed. During a summer vacation in England, William met, fell in love with and married Victoria (""Vickie"") Cromwell, a celebrated stage star. He brought her back to America with him, and they shared what William called ""a Charles Addams mansion,"" a rented house that William had found lonely and empty until Vickie arrived; Vickie found it a home no matter what William thought (""I never had a home of my own. It was hotel rooms and flats or living out of the backs of dressing rooms""). Their new residence is One Faculty Row, a house reserved for the president of Ivy College. Vickie sometimes calls William ""Toddie,"" and William's pride and joy is coming out ahead with the finances. Professor Warren is one of the dedicated instructors at Ivy. ""Teaching hardly ever pays off in money,"" he says. ""And it hardly ever pays off in glory. I myself can name ten baseball players or ten burlesque queens, bless em, for every teacher you can bring to mind. It's pride in the job that makes us stick with it."" It is also a good bet to avoid accepting an invitation for coffee from Professor Warren: ""In all the world no one concocts as nauseating a cup of coffee as I do."" Alice is the Halls' housekeeper, and Clarence Wellman is the chairman of the board of Ivy College (Sarah Selby appears as his wife, Mrs. Wellman). Ivy is a small school and always has been.

Their best friends are upstairs neighbors Ed Norton and his wife Trixie. Ralph works as a bus driver (the Madison Avenue route) for the Gotham Bus Company. He attended PS. 73 grammar school and at age 14 had his first job as a newspaper delivery boy. He met his future wife, Alice Gibson, during a winter snowstorm. Ralph was assigned to shovel snow by the WPA and met Alice, a WPA employee handing out snow shovels. Alice is not a demanding wife. She doesn't have any modern conveniences and feels that living in a tent would be better than the archaic apartment she and Ralph now occupy. She puts up with Ralph and his constant yelling (and promises to provide her with everything when his ship comes in) because she loves him.""Hominia, homina, homina"" is what Ralph says when he doesn't know what to say; ""I've got a big mouth!"" is what he says when he reahzes he shouldn't have said something.

Ralph is thought of as cheap and hopes, through one of his crazy ideas (as Alice calls them) to make a fortune. He and Ed are members of the Raccoon Lodge. Ed works as an ""Engineer in Subterranean Sanitation"" (a sewer worker for the Department of Sanitation).

After rattling off a list of actresses, none of whom were suitable for one reason or another, Meadows finally suggested herself. \'Jackie Gleason (I)\' (qv) initially rejected her on the grounds that she was too young and pretty. Meadows, determined to get the part, had a photographer come to her house at 7:00 the next morning, and had pictures taken of herself without makeup, her hair pinned up with combs she\'d slept on, and wearing a torn blouse, a skirt, and an apron. When Gleason saw the pictures he exclaimed happily, ""That\'s Alice!"" and asked who it was. When told it was the same young actress he\'d rejected the day before, he said, ""Any dame with a sense of humor like that deserves the job. Hire her!""'

 '\'Audrey Meadows\' (qv) was the only cast member to receive residual payments for the show for her entire life.

As a part of her contract, she was told to stipulate that if the show were to air in subsequent time slots in the future, she would be paid royalties, which is an interesting bit of history because it\'s now a standard condition for all TV work that the involved parties from an episode should get paid for each showing of it. These days it applies to directors, actors, writers, and voice actors, along with others in different capacities as well.'
 ""'Jackie Gleason (I)' (qv) rarely liked to rehearse, as he feared it killed the spontaneity of his performance. Co-stars 'Art Carney' (qv), 'Audrey Meadows' (qv) and 'Joyce Randolph' (qv) eventually took to rehearsing without him, taking turns standing in for him in scenes where Ralph Kramden appeared.""

 The Invisible Man. ,Series, Adventure, Syn.," Peter Brady is a British scientist concerned with the problems of optical density (the refraction of light). He is stationed at the Castle Hill Research Lab in England. During a test, reactor number three springs a leak and sprays Peter with a gas. His body absorbs the gas and it renders him invisible. Brady, however, lacks the knowledge to become visible. (He wears facial bandages, sunglasses and gloves to be seen. In one episode, Peter mentions that his clothes will become invisible if they are made of animal fibers, such as wool.) Before Peter can do anything, he is put under lock and key by the Ministry (they fear panic will result if it is known an invisible man exists). Through the use of his invisibility, Peter escapes and retreats to the home of his sister, Diane Wilson. There he explains to Diane and her daughter, Sally, what has happened. He concludes with, ""It's quite simple. Take a jellyfish, put it in water and you can't see it. That's happened to me. My reflective index has been lowered to that of theirs."" The situation changes drastically when a rival experimenter learns what has happened and attempts to steal Brady's formula for invisibility. The Ministry reverses its decision about Peter and allows him to continue his research: to find the key to becoming visible again. In the meantime, Peter uses his great advantage of invisibility to assist the British government in its battle against crime. In laterepisodes, Peter's invisibility is known to the general public. The identity of the actor portraying the lead (Peter Brady) had been (and still is) a closely guarded secret. (The cast for each episode, including the regulars, is listed only during the end credits. While the lead is listed first, he is credited only as ""The Invisible Man""; the remainder of the cast follows, each with a character name.) It has been rumored that series producer Ralph Smart played Brady (Smart did the same anonymous casting for The Iron Mask; see entry), or that actor Tim Turner, who appeared in the episode ""Man in Disguise,"" was actually the un-credited actor behind the bandages. The actor's identity was concealed not only from the public, but also from the cast and crew. (The actor wore bandages on the set; his voice was dubbed in after the episodes were shot. In some episodes he sounds American; in others there is a slight British accent.). A dramatically different version of the H.G. Wells story was produced in early 1958 but was scrapped and never aired. In it, Peter Brady is conducting an experiment in optical density on a guinea pig (which disappears, then reappears) when a reactor begins leaking. Peter's system absorbs too much of the gas, and he is rendered invisible; his clothes, however, do not become invisible. Peter is free to leave the lab; in fact, it is known that Peter Brady has become invisible (as television and newspaper reporters constantly annoy him). In this version he lives with his widowed sister Jane Wilson (Lisa Daniely) and her daughter Sally (Deborah Watling). It is difficult to predict how this version of the series would have progressed, since there was only one episode. Based on the storyline (Brady using his invisibility to rescue Sally from kidnappers) it appeared that he would either become a detective and use his invisibility to help solve crimes; or would follow the aired format and work with the British government _æ which would give him the greatest chance of discovering the formula for visibility. There is no real ending explaining what Brady would do next. Peter works for Sir Charles, the British cabinet minister. Sir Charles's superior is the prime minister. (Sir Charles and the prime minister did not appear in the unaired pilot version.) Theme: ""The Invisible Man Theme,"" by Sydney John Kay (both versions of the show).

He attended PS. 73 grammar school and at age 14 had his first job as a newspaper delivery boy. He met his future wife, Alice Gibson, during a winter snowstorm. Ralph was assigned to shovel snow by the WPA and met Alice, a WPA employee handing out snow shovels. Alice is not a demanding wife. She doesn't have any modern conveniences and feels that living in a tent would be better than the archaic apartment she and Ralph now occupy. She puts up with Ralph and his constant yelling (and promises to provide her with everything when his ship comes in) because she loves him.""Hominia, homina, homina"" is what Ralph says when he doesn't know what to say; ""I've got a big mouth!"" is what he says when he reahzes he shouldn't have said something.

 The Lone Ranger. ,Series, Western, ABC," ""I wear a mask in the cause of justice,"" says the Lone Ranger, a mysterious, early west lawman ""who cut a trail of law and order across seven states, forcing the powers of darkness into the blinding light of justice."" It was, however, a series of tragic events that transformed Texas Ranger John Reid into the Lone Ranger and teamed him with Tonto, the Potawatomi Indian who saved his life. It began with an assignment to capture Butch Cavendish, the head of the notorious Hole in theWall Gang. Butch, however, proved too clever for the Rangers to capture. At Bryant's Gap, a canyon about 50 yards wide and bound by cliffs, a team of six Texas Rangers are ambushed by the Cavendish gang and left for dead. Later that day Tonto, who had been hunting for food, finds a lone survivor of the attack _æ John Reid. Tonto brings Reid to the shelter of a small cave and begins nursing him back to health. As Reid recovers, he recalls Tonto as the Indian he befriended as a child. Years ago, when Tonto was a child, his village was raided by renegade Indians. His parents were killed and Tonto was left for dead. A young John Reid found Tonto and helped him recover from his wounds. It was at this time that Tonto called Reid ""Kemo Sabe"" (translated as both ""Faithful Friend"" and ""Trusted Scout""). There is a small patch of grassland that lies amid the rocks broken by countless years of wind and storm. On that land are six graves, each marked by a crudely constructed cross to represent the Texas Rangers who were killed _æ Captain Dan Reid (John's brother), Jim Bates, Jack Stacey, Joe Brent and Ben Cooper. The sixth cross bears the name of John Reid _æ put there by Tonto to convince Cavendish that all the Rangers had been killed; to conceal the fact that one Texas Ranger had lived to avenge the others _æ the Lone Ranger. To conceal his true identity, Reid fashions a mask from the black cloth of his brother's vest. At first, Reid and Tonto posed as outlaws to enable them to apprehend the Cavendish gang _æ some of which were hanged, others imprisoned. Once their goal was accomplished, they became a force for good _æ ""Wherever you find a wrong to be righted, that's where you'll find the Lone Ranger"" (Reid says also that ""keeping my identity a secret makes the pursuit of outlaws easier""). The Lone Ranger's trademark is the silver bullet _æ a precious metal that reminds him to shoot sparingly and to remember the high cost of human life. The silver comes from a mine Reid inherited. Jim Blaine is the old miner who works the Ranger's silver mine. George Wilson is the Ranger's secret banker in Border City who exchanges the silver for money. Later episodes feature Dan Reid, John's nephew, as an assistant. The Lone Ranger rides a white horse named Silver (whom he calls ""Big Fella""). Scout is Tonto's horse; Victor is Dan's horse. Father Paul is Reid's friend, the padre at the San Brado Mission. As the show's theme, ""The William Tell Overture"" by Rossini plays, an announcer's voice is heard: ""A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty Hi-yo Silver! The Lone Ranger! With his faithful Indian companion, Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early West. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear; the Lone Ranger rides again!""The program's closing is just as famous. While there were many variations, a typical sequence would begin with a man saying ""You know those two men saved my life and I didn't even get the Masked Man's name."" A sheriff would respond, ""A name's not important. It's what a man does that counts. No man has done more for the west than The Lone Ranger."" As the Ranger and Tonto ride into the sunset, ""Hiyo Silver"" is heard. The series is based on the radio program created by George W. Trendle.

 'The radio program, the TV series used incidental music from Republic Pictures serials (although with new orchestral arrangements) to fit the many action sequences. Program creator \'George W.

 ""At one time, speculation surfaced that the Lone Ranger was inspired by a US marshal named Bass Reeves, who worked in the Oklahoma Territory. Because the territory was largely Indian reservations--and therefore sovereign territory--marshals had to be accompanied by a Native American, hence some suggested this was the inspiration for the character of Tonto. Despite a sterling reputation for maintaining law and order, even when it meant arresting his own son, Reeves was eventually driven from office when Jim Crow laws were passed. Unlike the television show, the real Bass Reeves was black. This myth, along with other speculative suggestions for the character's origin, was eventually debunked by re-examining the records of the Detroit radio station where the Lone Ranger radio show originated.""

 Dobie Gillis. ,Series, Comedy, CBS," Dobie Gillis and his friend, Maynard G. Krebs, are teenagers who live in a mythical community called Central City. Dobie lives with his father, Herbert T. Gillis, and his mother, Winifrid (""Winnie"") Gillis, at 285 Norwood Street; Maynard lives with his parents at 1343 South Elm Street. At 285 Norwood one will also find the Gillis Grocery Store, which is run by Herbert, a hard working, always complaining businessman (he and the family live above the store). Herbert is a member of the Benevolent Order of the Bison Lodge and always claims he is 46 years old. He is known as a cheapskate and was voted the ""citizen most likely to hang onto his last dollar."" Dobie and Maynard first attend Central City High School, then S. Peter Pryor Junior College. Their favorite after school hangout is Charlie Wong's Ice Cream Parlor, and in 1961 they both served a hitch in the army (in some episodes they are in Company A; in others Company C and Company Q). In college Dobie was the second assistant editor of the school's newspaper, the Pryor Crier. Dobie is the girl chasing, all-American teenage boy; unfortunately, he ""picks girls with caviar tastes for his peanut butter wallet."" While schoolmate Zelda Gilroy has a never ending crush on him and has set her sights on marrying him, Dobie has eyes for beautiful girls who seem to cause him only misery. Dobie is most famous for his infatuation with thestunning Thalia Menninger, the girl who knows Dobie is dirt poor and the son of a cheap father, but who has high hopes of his making ""oodles and oodles of money"" _æ not for her but for her family, ""a  60-year-old father with a kidney condition, a mother who isn't getting any younger, a sister who married a loafer and a brother who is becoming a public charge."" Dobie's rival for Thalia is Milton Armitage, the rich, spoiled schoolmate who nicknamed her ""Mouse"" for her inability to choose between him and Dobie. Although the Thalia character was dropped when Tuesday Weld left the series, a new beauty _æ Linda Sue Faversham was brought on to tempt Dobie in  1961. Like Thalia, Linda Sue seeks only to marry money and has high hopes of turning Dobie into a success so they can marry and support her unemployable family. Following in Linda Sue's footsteps is her gorgeous sister, Amanda Jean who is being groomed by Linda Sue to marry money. Following in Dobie's footsteps is his younger, dirt poor cousin, Duncan Gillis, who fell for Amanda Jean and found, like Dobie, that girls like Linda Sue (and Amanda Jean) ""are not for poor slobs like us."" Maynard, a beatnik who loves to play the bongo drums, is also a fan of jazz and hangs out at RifiF Ryan's Music Store. He has a stuffed armadillo named Herman and claims that the G in his name stands for Walter. He also has the world's largest collection of tin foil. While the longest word that he can pronounce is delicatessen, Maynard's idea of great Americans include General MacArthur, Admiral Dewey and Captain Kangaroo. Maynard always responds with ""You rang?"" when his name is mentioned and panics when he hears the word ""work."" Zelda Gilroy, the girl who taught Dobie how to play the guitar, is very intelligent (one of the reasons why she thinks that Dobie is not attracted to her). She is pretty but not as attractive as the girls Dobie falls for; she is always there for Dobie when he is dumped by his latest heartthrob. Zelda is from a large family and has six sisters (played by Sherry Alberoni, Jeri Lou James, Larraine Gillespie, Judy Hackett, Marlene Willis and Anna Marie Nanassi). Chatsworth Osborne, Jr., is the rich and spoiled son of Clarissa Osborne and is a friend of Dobie and Maynard's. He has type ""R"" (for royal) blood and is heir to the fabulous Osborne National Bank fortune. He lives in a 47-room Louis XIV home (with broken glass embedded in the wall that surrounds it), belongs to the Downshifters Club, is president of the Silver Spoon Club (for snobs) at S. Peter Pryor Junior College and dreams of getting into Yale University. His favorite expression is ""mice and rats."" He calls Dobie ""Dobie Do"" and his mother ""Mumsey"" (she calls him ""you nasty boy"").Professor Leander Pomfritt teaches English at the high school and later at the college. He refers to his students as ""young barbarians."" He wrote nine novels (destroying eight of them) and wishes, at times, that he had gone into the aluminum siding business (also the air conditioning business, in some episodes). Dr. Imogene Burkhart teaches psychology and biology at the high school. In early episodes, Jean Byron appeared as Ruth Adams, the math teacher at Central High. The character of Imogene Burkhart was originally played by Jody Warner _æ not as a teacher, but as a classmate on whom Dobie had a crush. The series is also known as The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.

 ""Sensitive teenager Dobie Gillis (yes, Dobie being his real given name) exasperates his grocer father Herbert T. Gillis and is the apple of Winnie Gillis' eye, she being his mother. Dobie has an almost singular focus on the opposite sex, more often than not the object of his affection being the beautiful but money hungry Thalia Menninger, who in turn often loves Dobie but always loves money more, which Dobie never has and in his current life direction probably will never have to the extent that would satisfy Thalia.

 The Mickey Mouse Club. ,Series, Children, ABC," For an hour (later half an hour) each weekday afternoon, children of all ages were entertained by a group of talented children (called ""Mouseketeers"") who were members of the Mickey Mouse Club. There were no rules and there were no fees; the only requirement was to have fun _æ to sit back, ""put on your Mouseke-ears"" and join the Mouseketeers in songs, dances and sketches. ""Who's the leader of the club that's made for you and me"" meant the start of the show and fun with club leader Mickey Mouse and his friends. While Mickey Mouse appeared in animated form to introduce each episode, it was Jimmie Dodd and co-host Roy Williams who actually conducted the club. The stage was the official Mouse Club House and the Mouseketeers were introduced in many ways via song. The sight of Mickey, seated at a piano meant it was Monday and ""Fun with Music Day."" Tuesday found Mickey in a tuxedo and preparing for ""Guest Star Day."" A flying carpet, carrying Mickey in a sorcerer's suit, meant Wednesday's ""Anything Can Happen Day."" Thursday's ""Circus Day"" found Mickey dressed as a ringmaster. And ""Talent Round Up Day"" was the Friday show, with Mickey outfitted in cowboy duds. ""Time to twist our Mouseke-dial to the right and left with a great big smile; this is the way we get tosee a mouse cartoon for you and me. Meeska, Mooseka, Mouseketeer, Mouse Cartoon Time is now here"" (a door to the Mickey Mouse Treasure Mine would then open and a Disney cartoon would be seen). ""From the far corners of the Earth; from across the Seven Seas, the stories of today for the leaders of tomorrow"" signaled the beginning of ""The Mickey Mouse Club Newsreel"" (reported by Hal Gibney). ""Fun with a Camera"" was a segment with photographer Earl Kyser teaching the Mouseketeers aspects of photography. A daily serial was also a part of the program. For information on the major serials that were presented, see the following titles: Annette, Corky and White Shadow, The Hardy Boys and the Mystery of the Applegate Treasure, The Hardy Boys and the Mystery of Ghost Farm, Spin and Marty, The Further Adventures of Spin and Marty and The New Adventures of Spin and Marty. Other segments included the animated Jiminy Cricket in safety segments for children, and ""Sooty and His Friend Harry Corbett"" (Harry is the straight man for his non-speaking hand puppet. Sooty, who plays songs on his electric organ). Jimmie Dodd, who played the Mouseguitar (especially made by the Mattel Toy Company), concluded each show with a Words of Wisdom segment. (For example, Jimmie, holding a rubber band, would say, ""You know, Mouseketeers, this rubber band is a lot like truth. You can twist it but it will always come back the way it was. It is strong, but you can stretch it. The more you stretch it, the thinner it gets. Finally you can't stretch it any further and it's so thin you can't hold it _æ and that's the time it's going to snap back. And when it does, you're the one that's been hurt. The truth is just the same as it was. You haven't changed it; but by twisting and stretching it, you've hurt yourself."") ""Now it's time to say goodbye to all our company.

 The Millionaire. ,Series, Drama, CBS," A man, seated behind a desk, speaks: ""My name is Michael Anthony. For many years, I was executive secretary to the late multibiUionaire, John Beresford Tipton. He was one of the very few men who ever earned, by the use of his phenomenal brain, a fortune that ran into the billions of dollars. Among my duties was the unique job of delivering one million dollars which Mr. Tipton frequently gave away tax free, to a total stranger."" Of the 2.5 billion people populating the world in  1955, only 19 were worth $500 million or more. One such man was John Beresford Tipton (never fully seen). Mr. Tipton lived a life of treasured seclusion and conducted his business activities from Silverstone, his 60,000 acre estate. Here, he indulged in many hobbies, the most unusual of which began when his doctor told him that he must find a means of relaxation. Mr. Tipton, seated in his study, is toying with one of his ivory chess figures, when he sends for his executive secretary, Michael Anthony. ""You sent for me, sir?"" ""You know, Mike,"" Tipton says, ""these chessmen were the first luxury I ever allowed myself ... I decided to make my hobby a chess game with human beings ... I'm going to choose a number of people for my chessmen and give them each a million dollars. The bank will issue the check.... No one is to ever know that I'm the donor. I want a complete report on what happens to each person's life in writing."" After Mr. Tipton's death, the will instructed Michael Anthony to reveal the files of people, selected by a means known only to Mr. Tipton, who were mysteriously presented with a tax free cashier's check for one million dollars. Via flashback sequences, John Beresford Tipton's intrusion on fate is revealed as stories disclose how the money helped or hindered lives. John Beresford Tipton issued 188 checks for onemillion dollars (drawn on the Gotham City Trust and Savings Bank). His unique hobby was related to the subject of human nature. ""Every subject in his vast store of knowledge was close analysis and was always related to the behavior and destiny of man."" Each check recipient must sign a document agreeing never to reveal the exact nature of the gift or its amount. Spouses can be told, but telling anyone else results in a forfeiture of any remaining monies. The series' catchphrases were : (Mike) ""You sent for me, sir,"" and (Tipton, handing Mike a check) ""Mike, our next millionaire."" The series is also known as If You Had a Million.

 The People's Choice. ,Series, Comedy, CBS," New City California, is a city built in a hurry. It is famous for its lettuce crops, and it is near Los Angeles. Some people have streetUghts, some have no sewers, some have terrible roads. Socrates (""Sock"") Miller and his aunt, Augusta ""Gus"" Bennett, live in a trailer camp in New City's Paradise Park. Sock, who graduated from Cornell University (Phi Beta Kappa), was raised by his aunt followinghis parents' deaths when he was three years old. He served a hitch in Korea (as a marine sergeant) and is now an ornithologist for the government's Bureau of Fish and Wildlife. His job is to ""follow the birds"" (he files reports on migratory birds, as their flights foretell climatic conditions and aid farmers when planting crops). There is one other resident living with Sock _æ his basset hound, Cleo. Cleo was six months old when Sock, a corporal at the time, won her in a crap game. Cleo, whose thoughts can be heard by voiceover dubbing, is glad that Sock can't talk for her _æ ""If he could, I'd be off the show."" One day Sock befriends Amanda (""Mandy"") Peoples, the pretty daughter of New City's mayor, John Peoples, when she becomes stranded on a country road and he stops to fix her flat tire. It seems like love at first sight. Mandy feels that Sock is the right man to fill a city council vacancy. She delivers a television speech in which she urges voters to elect Sock as their 5th District councilman. If they want paved roads, sewers and streetlights, then Sock Miller is their man. Sock wins the election and is given an oflice on the first floor of the Municipal Building. (Sock received special permission from the Department of Fish and Wildlife, Western Division, to remain in New City until his term of office is completed.) Two marriages resulted on the series. Aunt Gus married Mayor Peoples and Sock married Mandy in  1957. Shortly after his marriage, Sock applies for a position as a lawyer with Barker Amalgamated in New York City. They hire Sock _æ but as the sales manager for Barkerville, a housing development with 294 houses for sale ""20 miles from nowhere."" Houses sell for $15,995, and Sock and Mandy live rent free in the model house (number 119). Valerie Delmar (Jean Porter) was Sock's girlfriend before Mandy; lawyer Roger Crutcher (John Stephenson) was Mandy's boyfriend prior to Sock. John calls Sock ""Nature Boy"" and Gus ""Mousey."" He also owns part interest in a whaling ship in Seattle. Hexley (""Hex"") RoUo is a friend of Sock's from childhood who now resides in New City. They were in the marines together; when stationed at Fort Baxter, RoUo (who is cursed with bad luck) lost a 20 ton amphibious tank. Pierre Quincy is Sock's friend, an eccentric painter.

 The Plainclothesman. ,Series, Crime Drama, DuMont," The subjective camera method is used to detail the investigations of a never-seen lieutenant with the New York City Police Department. By use of the subjective camera, which enacts emotion and becomes the eyes of the lieutenant, the viewer hears the actor's voice and experiences situations as if he were actually present. If, for example, a suspect throws a punch, the camera bolts, indicating that the lieutenant took the brunt of the blow. The unseen detective is relentless and once on a case, does what it takes to get the job done. The technique was first used effectively in the feature film Lady in the Lake and plays well on television as the lieutenant investigates homicide cases.

Johnny was born in the town of Mason.

Johnny's mother died when he was very young; his father, Ned Yuma, raised him.

 ""Lucas McCain's rifle is an 1892 .44-40 Winchester.""
 ""'Chuck Connors (I)' (qv) initially turned down the role of Lucas McCain because he thought the salary was too low.

 'In some of the episodes, note that Lucas McCain (without any connection or relevance to the plot) will handle and fire his rifle with equal precision, sometimes with his right hand, and other times with his left hand. An explanation has never been given for this ambidextrous ability.'

 'Due to budgetary constraints in its second season, the network decided to cut costs by shooting some episodes on videotape rather than film. Because videotape was a relatively primitive medium in the early 1960s, the editing of tape was next to impossible. Thus, each of the six episodes was ""camera-cut"" as in live TV, on a studio sound stage, using a total of four cameras. The requisite multicamera setup of the videotape experiment pretty much precluded location shooting, severely limiting the potential scope of the story-lines, and so the short-lived experiment was ultimately abandoned. The limitations of using videotape (e.g., it could not be edited as cleanly as film and its visual quality was poorer) led the network to switch back to film for the rest of the series, despite the greater cost. The six videotaped episodes were titled: _""The Twilight Zone"" (1959) {The Lateness of the Hour (#2.8)}_ (qv); _""The Twilight Zone"" (1959) {Static (#2.20)}_ (qv); _""The Twilight Zone"" (1959) {The Whole Truth (#2.14)}_ (qv); _""The Twilight Zone"" (1959) {The Night of the Meek (#2.11)}_ (qv); _""The Twilight Zone"" (1959) {Twenty Two (#2.17)}_ (qv); _""The Twilight Zone"" (1959) {Long Distance Call (#2.22)}_ (qv) and then transferred to film for broadcast, which saved the producers about $5,000 per episode.'
 '\'Rod Serling\' (qv) thought he had come up with the term ""Twilight Zone"" on his own (he liked the sound of it), but after the show aired he found out that it is an actual term used by Air Force pilots when crossing the day / night sides above the world.'
 'Series creator \'Rod Serling\' (qv) made up the phrase ""Sixth Dimension"" to use in season one\'s opening narration. \'William Self (I)\' (qv) of CBS-TV asked him what was the fifth dimension (given that dimensions one through three are exemplified by a line, a plane, and a cube, respectively, and the fourth is time). Serling answered, ""I don\'t know. Aren\'t there five?"" He then changed the narration to ""There is a fifth dimension...""'
 'Although the phrase ""Submitted for your approval"" from \'Rod Serling\' (qv)\'s opening narration has come to be closely identified with the show (and is often used by Serling impressionists), it is actually heard in only three episodes: _""The Twilight Zone"" (1959) {Cavender Is Coming (#3.36)}_ (qv), _""The Twilight Zone"" (1959) {In Praise of Pip (#5.1)}_ (qv), and _""The Twilight Zone"" (1959) {A Kind of a Stopwatch (#5.4)}_ (qv).

 'A local Cincinnati TV show that ran until 1985, the longest local show in TV history. Musician and artist Al Lewis hosted the show ""The Corner Drug Store."" He would draw pictures and play his accordion. Children outside the studios heard the happy accordion music and wandered in and started jumping up and down to the polka music. Al Lewis was pleased and surprised with the response. It got to be an everyday occurrence with more and more children coming in the studios dancing and hopping around to the music. Hundreds of letters would pour in from parents wondering how they could get their children on his show. WCPO TV started sending tickets out and reserved enough to fill the studio. The response was so overwhelming that the ticket list would be booked up for two years. Now with so many children to entertain, Lewis, who was now being called Uncle Al needed assistance. Lewis added to his show, his wife Wanda, whom he called Captain Windy because she would fly like the wind in the air and down to his show.Old style sideway camera tricks used in B movies like the Superman serials would be used to show her flying. Later puppeteer Larry Smith would join the show and then popular producer and voice over announcer Mike Tangi came on board. The DuMont then ABC Network picked up the show for about a year in 1958. The sets became more elaborate and the setting for a while took place at a farm and for a few years the setting was a circus.

 The Untouchables. ,Series, Crime Drama, ABC," Chicago during its turbulent years of mobster rule during the late 1920s and '30s is the setting. Walter Winchell, the program's narrator, tells us that in 1929 the country was dry _æ bootlegged beer had been outlawed _æ but through conveyance with Al Capone, Chicago was wet _æ helped by corrupt officials and a public that was indifferent. To battle Capone and stop his illegal activities, the U.S. District Attorney assigns their top Prohibition Agent, 26-year-old Eliot Ness the task. There are 300 federal agents in Chicago. ""Some can be bought,"" says Ness, ""but what if you have a special squad, small, operating on its own; every man thoroughly investigated; brought in from all parts of the country. Men who will spit on Capone's graft; just a few he can't buy."" On June 28, 1929, Ness is given full access to all federal agents' files. His task: to find six or seven men who are reliable, courageous, dedicated and honest. ""Six or seven of the most honest men."" Several days later, on July 5,  1929, in office 208 of the Federal Building in Washington, D.C., Ness meets with the men he has chosen to become the Federal Special Squad, dubbed ""The Untouchables"" by the press, as they cannot be touched by the mob: Martin Flaherty, a former Boston police oiScer with an outstanding arrest record; William Longfellow, a full-blooded Cherokee Indian, responsible for the breakup of the Oklahoma booze ring; Jack Rossman, a former New York telephone company lineman, now a wiretap expert; Lamar Kane, an agent with the Richmond, Virginia, bureau, a law school graduate, married and the father of two children; Eric Hanson of the San Francisco bureau, a former guard at San Quentin's Death Row Prison; and Enrico Rossi, a former barber who became an agent after he testified as a witness against mobster Frank Nitti. He witnessed a mob hit that claimed the life of an innocent 17 -yearold girl. The pilot episode, broadcast as two segments of Desilu Playhouse (April 20 and 27, 1959) also featured agents Tom Kopka (Robert Osterloh) of the Sacramento Bureau, a former Pennsylvania State Trooper and World War I hero, and Joe Fuscelli (Keenan Wynn), a man who speaks the Sicilian and Neopolitan dialects, who spent five years in prison for robbery and knows every street and alley in the city _æ the best driving hands in Chicago. Joe was killed off and Tom was dropped. They were replaced by agents Lee Hobson (Paul Picerni) and Cam Allison (Anthony George). At the age of 26, Eliot Ness headed the most elite crime fighting unit in the country. While it took him 18 months to bring Capone to justice (nailing him on an income tax evasion charge), Ness fought corruption until his death in 1957. The team was first dubbed ""The Untouchables"" by the Chicago Bulletin when it ran the headline ""Untouchables Defy Capone."" Al Capone had his headquarters in a room above the Montmartre Cafe in Chicago. When caught by Ness, he was sentenced to 11 years in the Atlanta State Penitentiary. Eliot dated Betty Anderson (Patricia Crowley) and married her in November of 1929. In the pilot episode. Bill Williams played Martin Flaherty; Paul Dubov was Jack Rossman; and Paul Picerni was Tom Lugari. Note: NBC aired The Return of Eliot Ness, a twohour TV movie on November 10, 1991, wherein Robert Stack reprised his role as Eliot Ness. The story is set in Chicago in 1947. Eliot has been living in Omaha but returns to Chicago when former Untouchable, Marty Labine, is killed in what appears to be a cop-on-the-take situation. Ness teams with Marty's son, police sergeant Gil Labine ( Jack Coleman) and proves that Marty was framed by a mobster who wanted to further his position in the organization.

Other characters include Moon Mad Tiger, Jack Webfoot (a takeoff on Dragnet), TATTf Lou and Hey You, The Double Feature Creature with the Supersonic Sound, Marilyn Mongrel (a takeoff on Marilyn Monroe), Louie the Lone Shark, The Wildman and Go Man Gogh (both voiced by Scatman Crothers). Cecil was a cloth hand puppet with a movable mouth (but only his head and neck were seen). With the addition of clever dialogue, imaginative painted backgrounds and music and sound effects, a primitive but effective series was sustained for four years. See also The Beany and Cecil Show. Voice Cast: Daws Butler (Beany/Uncle Captain), Stan Freberg (Cecil/Dishonest John), Scatman Crothers {WildmanI Go Man Gogh), Herb Shoemaker, Walker Edmiston, Jim MacGeorge, Bill Oberlin.

 ""Time for Beany was an American television series, with puppets for characters, which aired locally in Los Angeles starting in 1949 and nationally (via kinescope) on the improvised Paramount Television Network from 1950 to 1955. It was created by animator Bob Clampett, who later reused its core characters in the animated Beany and Cecil series. The principal characters were Beany, a plucky young boy who wears a beanie; the brave but dimwitted Cecil the Seasick Sea Serpent, who claimed to be 300 years old and 35 feet 3 inches tall; Beany's uncle, the pigheaded Captain Horatio Huffenpuff (whose name is a play on Horatio Hornblower), familiarly called Uncle Captain; Dishonest John, whose cape and handlebar mustache clearly identified him as the villain.""]","['Thanks primarily to \'Robert Clampett\' (qv)\'s clever scripts and the outstanding voice work of \'Daws Butler\' (qv) and \'Stan Freberg\' (qv), ""Time For Beany"" was a show whose appeal stretched well beyond that of the average children\'s show of the time. This is evidenced by the fact that the show\'s fans included \'Albert Einstein\' (qv), \'Lionel Barrymore\' (qv), \'Ethel Barrymore\' (qv), \'Aldous Huxley\' (qv) and \'Adlai Stevenson\' (qv).'
 '""Time For Beany"" originated from Paramount\'s KTLA-TV studio and did fifteen minute shows, five days a week, fifty-two weeks a year for six years. During that time winning three Emmys for Best Children\'s Program in 1949, 1950 and 1952. The show also nominated in 1954 but didn\'t win, winning the Peabody award. Stan Freberg was nominated, as Cecil, for a Best Actor Emmy in 1950 but didn\'t win. Clampet won the first of his three Emmys for the Beany show, At the dinner he presented his Emmy to his mother in thanks for helping make the first Cecil puppet.'
 'Clampett integrated popular music into his ""Time for Beany"" puppet show....nightly! Famed organist Korla Pandit effortlessly blended so many musical cues in combination with Beany themes and story points that he could certainly have made a claim as an early innovator in music sampling. And of course ""Raggmopp"" which debuted the same year as ""Time for Beany"" was such a popular song on the show that it in effect became Cecil\'s theme song.'
 ""In 1948, while performing in Hollywood at a furrier's fashion show in Tom Breneman's Restaurant, Korla and Beryl met television pioneer Klaus Landsberg who offered Korla his own 15-minute daily television show with the stipulation that he would also provide musical accompaniment for Time for Beany, Bob Clampett's popular puppet show which featured Stan Freberg and Daws Butler as puppeteers and voices.""
 'Bob Clampett gave birth to Time For Beany in his garage, as he opens door to let Stan Freberg and Daws Butler inside. The garage was just off the main drag of LaBrea Ave. in the middle of Hollywood, near Beverly Boulevard. It housed the puppets in the late 1940s.'
 'Bob Clampett\'s Time for Beany featuring Cecil, the Sea Sick Sea Serpent, made out of pale green terry-cloth for skin with sewn on eyes and buttons representing nostrils, premiered on February 28, 1949 from Los Angeles television station KTLA-Channel 5 that was adjacent to the Paramount movie lot, ""Time for Beany"" ran live Monday through Friday in fifteen minute installments for five years. (Kinescopes, the videotape equivalent of the day, were later sent to stations nationwide.)'
 'It was rumored that Albert Einstein liked it so much, he stopped work every day to watch. He was addressing a group of Nobel prize winners in 1950, and stopped abruptly, telling his audience he had to leave since it was ""Time for Beany"". Groucho Marx of the Marx Brothers wrote that it was the only show adult enough for his young daughter Melinda to watch. In fact, Groucho even made ""Time For Beany"" references on his own popular early television program, ""You Bet Your Life"". Actor Jimmy Stewart pleaded with Paramount not to change the show\'s air time so that he would not be forced to miss it. When actor Lionel Barrymore worked on the MGM set, studio head Louis B. Mayer forbade television sets on the lot because he felt they were a threat to the motion picture industry. So, Barrymore was forced to send his chauffeur to a local bar to watch ""Time For Beany"" and return to report on the plot developments in the puppet show when he wasn\'t able to see it himself because of the shooting schedule.'

" Tom Corbett, Space Cadet. ",Series, Adventure," CBS, NBC, ABC, DuMont"," It is the year 2350 and the planets Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Venus have been colonized. They are part of the Solar Alliance and protected by the Solar Guards, a celestial police force that is based at Space Academy, U.S.A., a training school for aspiring Solar Guards. Space Academy itself enlists men of high school and college age to train as Solar Guards. While not readily explained, women are not permitted to become Solar Guards. They can, however, train as Auxiliary Cadets to assist Solar Guards in times of emergency. Stories follow the adventures of Solar Guards Tom Corbett, Astro and Roger Manning. Major Ben Connell, called ""Blastoff"" by the cadets, is the roughest, toughest and meanest officer in the Solar Guards, while Dr. Joan Dale, is the kindest of instructors at Space Academy. Tom, Roger and Astro are assigned to training on the Polaris. While supposedly only a cadet, Tom appeared to be more of an academy official (he gave orders, charted flights and booked space maneuvers). He was strong and forceful and showed leadership quality. He was also quick thinking, assertive and popular with all those he worked with. Early episodes find Tom as the storyteller. He is seated in an official-looking office and welcomes viewers to relate an adventure he shared with Roger and Astro. A flashback-type of sequence is used and Tom returns at the end of the story to relate the moral and bid farewell with his famous ""So long for now and spaceman's luck to all of you."" Astro was the alien member of the team. He was born to Teron parents on the planet Venus (at a time when it was just being colonized) and is considered to be a Venusian by his colleagues. He is a naturalborn engineer and his job is to oversee the rocket motors on the power deck of the Polaris. Astro has a quick temper and frequently acts without thinking first. Roger is a wise guy, sarcastic and always causing trouble (especially with his habit of playing practical jokes). He often taunts Astro and causes endless rifts between them. While he did work on the radar bridge (near the nose of the Polaris) he also thoughthe was better than everyone else (boasting of his own accomplishments while downgrading those of his colleagues). Why Roger was not expelled is a mystery, but in time of dire need he became helpful (but in the end he would always give into temptation and belittle others). He was replaced in last season episodes by Cadet T.J. Thistle, a non-practical jokeplaying student who had a chip on his shoulder (he felt his short height prevented him from achieving success). Dr. Joan Dale was the only regular female presence at the academy. She was a professional and dedicated to teaching. Joan was not a femme fatale (a girl always in need of rescuing). She was beautiful, educated, intelligent and capable of defending herself. Joan was also a researcher and inventor. She created Tom's rocket-powered space suit as well as a new rocket fuel and the Hyper Drive (which allowed the Solar Guards' rocket cruisers to reach nearby stars). Joan was not all work. She had a human side and would worry about her superior, Captain Steve Strong and Tom's crew when they were off on dangerous missions. Commander Arkwright was the stern principal of Space Academy; Cadet Eric Rattison headed the crew of the Vega; Rex Marshall appeared as Lieutenant Saunders in commercials for the show's longtime sponsor, Kellogg's Cereals (it was also sponsored by Kraft Foods and Red Goose shoes). Announcer Jackson Beck opened early episodes with these words: ""Space Academy, U.S.A., in the world beyond tomorrow. Here the space cadets train for duty on distant planets. In roaring rockets they blast through the millions of miles from Earth to far flung stars and brave the dangers of cosmic frontiers, protecting the liberties of the planets, safeguarding the cause of universal peace in the conquest of space.""

Topper, a henpecked bank vice president, inherited the ghosts three months after the Kerbys' death in Switzerland. (As part of their fifth wedding anniversary celebration, George and Marian decided to go skiing. Fifty miles from nowhere Marian's ski broke. While arguing about what to do, a drunken Saint Bernard came to their rescue. Before anything could be done, the three perished in an avalanche.) George and Marian have come back, apparently, to bring some fun into Topper's dull life. While measuring the floor for a carpet. Topper first realizes he has ghosts when he sees Marian's shapely legs, then the rest of her materialize. George then appears and Cosmo finds that his life is about to change forever as the ghosts will appear and speak only to him (coping with their antics and explaining unusual occurrences to other people becomes his biggest concern). George and Marian consider Topper's home to be theirs. Marian, an excellent cook, calls Cosmo ""Topper Darling"" while George, a former playboy who still has an eye for the ladies, calls Topper ""Old Man."" Because of his resemblance to George's cousin, Marian named the dog Neil. ""Neil is crazy about bones and beer"" says Marian. Topper is associated with the following banks: National Security Bank, City Bank, Gotham Trust Company and City Trust and Savings. Humphrey Schuyler, the bank president (all listed), enjoys raising chickens on his upstate farm (Hildergarde is his prize-winning chicken). Henrietta sees many unusual things and accepts her husband's explanations, but believes Cosmo amuses himself by pretending to be haunted by three ghosts. She is most bafiled by the front door _æ ""It opens and closes by itself"" (actually by George and Marian who prefer to enter and exit the house by opening the door as opposed to passing through it). It was Henrietta who talked Cosmo into moving (thinking their apartment was too small). Her parents never liked Cosmo; they believed he was not good enough for her. Henrietta is a member of the Ladies' Drama Committee. Over the course of the series, the Toppers had three maids: a girl named Vilma who appeared in the pilot but without a credit; Katie, a maid from the Abba Agency; and Maggie.

 Wanted: Dead or Alive. ,Series, Western, CBS," On March 7, 1957, ""The Bounty Man"" aired on the CBS series Trackdown. It introduced viewers to a bounty hunter named Josh Randall and spawned the successful series Wanted: Dead or Alive. While millions of people saw the episode, only potential sponsors saw the show's sales pitch (which played right before the closing theme). It went like this: ""Hi, my name is Steve McQueen. 1 hope you liked what you just saw. Kind of a new approach to Westerns. 1 hope you liked Josh Randall. Oh, he's not a lawman, but he's got a lot of friends who are. And they like him because he respects them and their jobs. Since Josh doesn't wear a badge, he can take the shortest distance between two people. On these occasions, his lawmen friends kinda turn their heads and wish they could use the same methods. The stories on Wanted: Dead or Alive are about the people of the times; their dreams, their problems, their happiness.... There are a lot of stories on Wanted: Dead or Alive and they all have one thing in common _æ they all happen to people. Any way you slice it. Wanted: Dead or Alive is a good show, full of action, drama and adventure. Good entertainment for the whole family _æ and that's what'U sell any product. See y'all now."" The time is the 1870s, and being a bounty hunter ""wasn't a bad way to live. You got to see a lot of the country and meet a lot of people. It was a living and now and then a good one."" Josh Randall liked the life ""and it seemed to like him."" Though the world may be big and men can easily hide from the law. Josh finds that not a problem _æ ""He's a man; there's nowhere he can lay down his feet that I can't walk _æ I'll find him."" Josh's motto: ""If he's got a price on his head, I've got an empty pocket."" Josh is a compassionate bounty hunter and sometimes finds himself in the position of protector, struggling to safeguard his prisoners from the less scrupulous bounty hunters. Josh carries a .30-40 caliber sawed-off carbine hecalls his ""Mare's leg"": ""It's kinda like a hog's leg but not quite as mean. If I have to use it, I want to get the message across."" Josh's occasional assistant is Jason Nichols, a bounty hunter who travels with an unnamed mutt he calls ""Hey, Dog."" Cast: Steve McQueen {Josh Randall), Wright King {Jason Nichols), Gloria Talbot {Various Roles), Warren Oates {Various Roles). Theme Song: ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" by Rudy Schrager. ",1958,1961,[None 'Western'],[None],"[""'Steve McQueen (I)' (qv) was hired after 'Jack H. Harris' (qv), who was producing _The Blob (1958)_ (qv) gave him a glowing reference to 'Dick Powell (I)' (qv) (the head of Four Star Productions). Powell also asked for, and was granted, the opportunity to view a rough cut of that film.""
 '\'Steve McQueen (I)\' (qv)\'s characterization of a sympathetic bounty hunter was first tested in an episode of the Western series, _""Trackdown"" (1957)_ (qv) which starred \'Robert Culp\' (qv) as a Texas Ranger.'
 'According to the A&E Biography profile of \'Steve McQueen (I)\' (qv) (featured in the Season ONE DVD Set), McQueen took the role of Josh Randall because his prospects for acting in movies were drying up. When the series started becoming hit, McQueen began getting more and more noticed by the film industry. So much so that director \'John Sturges\' (qv), who\'d used McQueen in the war movie _Never So Few (1959)_ (qv) cast McQueen in the western hit _The Magnificent Seven (1960)_ (qv), the movie that launched McQueen\'s rise to stardom. After making ""Mag-7"", McQueen began to get more and more movie offers again and decided to quit the show to pursue his film career, thus canceling the series.'
 'After getting offered the chance to star in _The Magnificent Seven (1960)_ (qv), McQueen found out that the only way he could do the film, which was being shot simultaneously with ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"", was to fake an accident or illness and get a medical leave from the series. According to his first wife, Nellie, McQueen accomplished this feat by ""faking"" a car crash in which he merely crashed his car into a tree, receiving minor cuts, muscle pulls, and bruises, and getting his medical leave. The series\' production went on temporary hiatus while McQueen filmed ""The Magnificent Seven"".'
 'According to several episodes, Josh Randall was a war veteran having served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War.'
 'Initially, the creators of the series had a hard time selling the show because bounty hunters were thought to be unsavory characters and have been portrayed as such in numerous western shows and movies. The creators overcame this obstacle by having Josh Randall give most, sometimes ALL, of his earnings to help people such as the families of people murdered by the men Randall brings in, thus making Randall a sympathetic and likable character.'
 ""The Mare's Leg weapon carried by Josh Randall ('Steve McQueen (I)' (qv)) is a cut down Winchester model 1892 carbine in 44-40 caliber, but the bullets in his cartridge belt are 45-70 caliber rounds used in the larger, more powerful rifles of the day. The producers wanted to use the 45-70s because they were more visually impressive than the relatively small, pistol sized rounds actually used in the 1892 carbine. The use of the 1892 carbine is itself an anachronism as the series is set in the 1870s.""
 'The ""Mare\'s Leg"" firearm is a model 1892 Winchester (although the series is set in the 1870\'s) with shortened barrel and cut-off shoulder stock, a product of the era of ""gimmick"" guns in Westerns of the 1950\'s. Several firearms manufacturers produce firing replicas of this firearm and its holster. It is too short to be fired like a rifle and if fired like a handgun requires an awkward and uncomfortable angle on the wrist. Although visually striking, from a practical standpoint it is almost useless for self-defense.'
 ""There is a modern day Mare's leg. It is made by Henry Repeating Arms.The rifle holds 5 rounds and is a joy to shoot. To begin with if using this for self defense in say a home invasion it is much easier to carry around the house with you due to its shortened size. Having a green laser mounted on it, it becomes a formidable defense gun. I do not know who came up with the idea of this weapon for the series but Henry states in its catalog that it is modeled after the WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE weapon.""
 'A version of the gun (a Mare\'s leg) used by McQueen in this series is made by ROSSI. The ROSSI is 24 inches long (12 "" barrel) and available in up to .44 magnum caliber. It is legal in the USA as a \'handgun\'. The \'mare\'s leg\' style of gun was and is used by ranchers. It typically is sheathed in a holster on a horse\'s right front leg where the rider can easily reach it for defense of the rider or his livestock. The gun on the show fascinated a 10 year old boy who bought one 57 years later and thinks of \'Josh Randall\' every time he uses it. The \'mare\'s leg is great (ROSSI .44 magnum) for home defense and bears. ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" introduced a great gun to all of America.'
 'In Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) Woody Strode used a sawed down Winchester Model 1892 rifle, ""Mare\'s Leg"" as his weapon at the opening duel in a tribute to the Western series, Wanted: Dead or Alive (1958-1961).'
 'In ""My Name Is Nobody"" (1973) two of the headmen of the ""Wild Bunch"" gang carry a ""Mare\'s Leg"" firearm (A Model 1892 Winchester), in a tribute to the Western series, Wanted: Dead or Alive (1958-1961), in which Steve McQueen\'s bounty hunter used as a main weapon.'

Asked by a biographer (in 1976) if his client\'s condition was alcohol-related, Zanders replied, ""I don\'t say \'drunk.\' One of the things that brought it about was having one or two drinks and not eating. Her system ran down that way."" On February 5, 1961, with \'Bennett Cerf (I)\' (qv) on vacation, \'Arlene Francis\' (qv) went on live TV assuming Kilgallen was still in the hospital only to discover that she was the mystery guest. During an earlier absence from _""What\'s My Line?"" (1950)_ (qv) in 1958, Kilgallen had reportedly suffered (according to a newspaper wire service) from ""exhaustion and anemia."" When she missed several shows in 1965, \'John Daly (I)\' (qv) said on-air that she had injured herself tripping on a rug. She returned to the show with her arm in a sling and then appeared on every telecast for six months, including a live appearance on the night of her death.'
 ""A frequent panelist during the show's final two seasons was columnist 'Aileen Mehle' (qv), who appeared on the show using her pen name Suzy Knickerbocker.""
 ""'Michael Jackson (II)' (qv) (the Los Angeles radio host, not the singer) appeared on the August 7, 1960 broadcast as a contestant. This was during the time when he was a disc jockey in San Francisco. He later would gain fame as a radio talk-show host based in Los Angeles.""
 ""Legendary billiards hustler Minnessota Fats appeared on the January 17, 1965 broadcast. However, he signed in using his real name, 'Rudolf Wanderone Jr.' (qv) and he managed to completely fool the panel.""
 ""The studio from which CBS broadcast the series between 1960 and 1966 became the notorious Studio 54 discotheque in the 1970s and 1980s. Later it became a Broadway theater where 'Emma Stone (III)' (qv) is scheduled to perform the lead role in a revival of the 1960s musical Cabaret from November 11, 2014 to February 1, 2015.""
 ""The show's announcer 'Johnny Olson' (qv) was a mystery guest on the April 4, 1965 broadcast and completely stumped the panel by using several different voices.""
 ""In 'Arlene Francis' (qv)'s 1978 autobiography, she explains that she was hired as a panelist for the show from the very beginning. She said that she was supposed to appear on the first show, but was unable to attend that night, for some reason that she couldn't remember at the time she wrote her book. She makes her first appearance on the second show.""
 ""Contestant 'Pat Finch (I)' (qv) holds the record for most appearances on the series as a regular contestant. She appeared on the very first show in 1950 as a hat check girl working at the Stork Club in New York City. She then appeared on the fifth anniversary broadcast, but by that time she was working as a chorus girl on Broadway. She also appeared on the final broadcast in 1967. At the time of her final appearance, she was still appearing on Broadway. She had also gotten married and now had a five year old son.""
 ""'Martin Gabel' (qv) holds the record for the most number of appearances as a guest panelist.""
 ""'Lucille Ball' (qv) holds the record for the most appearances as mystery guest, with 5.""
 'The first sponsor of the program was Jules Montenier, Inc., which was owned by Dr. Jules Montenier. His company made Stopette spray deodorant, Poof! deodorant body powder, and Finesse ""flowing cream"" Shampoo.'
 'On the May 9, 1965 broadcast, \'Soupy Sales\' (qv) made his first ever appearance on _""What\'s My Line?"" (1950)_ (qv). Filling in as a guest panelist, his first words on the air were an introduction of \'Dorothy Kilgallen\' (qv). Sales did not sit on the panel again during the program\'s incarnation as a live show on CBS. Much later, as a regular on the syndicated version for seven seasons, he became known for identifying the lesser known of the mystery guests and for his slapstick humor during demonstrations of the contestants\' lines. He was a mystery guest on the CBS show twice: May 30, 1965 and May 29, 1966.'
 ""Colonel 'Harland Sanders' (qv), founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken, appeared on the December 1, 1963 broadcast. The panel wasn't blindfolded, however, because of the fact that he wasn't well known at the time. He later would appear on a 1970 broadcast of the syndicated version of the show only this time he was now a full fledged mystery guest and the panel was blindfolded on that occasion.""
 'Former Los Angeles mayor \'Sam Yorty\' (qv) appeared on the September 10, 1961 broadcast. He signed in as ""Mr. X,"" however. Even though some of the panelists might have recognized his name, they probably would have never seen his face since most of the panelists lived in New York. Guest panelist \'Art Linkletter\' (qv), however, did recognize him and voluntarily disqualified himself.'
 ""Legendary New York/San Francisco Giants broadcaster 'Russ Hodges' (qv) appeared on the October 7, 1962 broadcast. He was in town covering the World Series when he appeared. However, the panel didn't blindfold themselves because he felt confident that the panel wouldn't recognize him because of the fact that he wasn't on television that much, but he did sign in as Mr. X because he felt some of the panelists might have recognized his name.""
 ""When 'Anne Bancroft (I)' (qv) was the mystery guest on the July 1, 1962 broadcast, she answered the panel's questions not only verbally, but with sign language as well. This was her way of promoting the film _The Miracle Worker (1962)_ (qv).""
 'During the October 7, 1962 broadcast, an intruder made his way to the camera range while the panel was blindfolded for the mystery guest round (the mystery guest that night was \'Melina Mercouri\' (qv)). The intruder was quickly escorted off the sound stage by \'Johnny Olsen (I)\' (qv) and executive producer \'Gil Fates\' (qv). The only panelist who apparently realized what had happened was \'Victor Borge\' (qv), who joked about it during his next turn at questioning. According to \'Gil Fates\' (qv), the intruder seemed to be promoting a personal dating service. Fates wrote facetiously many years later, ""I guess the cops eventually let him go, because as far as I know no one has ever made it a crime to deliver a commercial on television.""'
 'On the October 21, 1962 broadcast, a man named Emanuel Ress, who had appeared ten years earlier, returned and again stumped the panel with his line of making political campaign buttons. Since the mid-term elections were only a couple of weeks away, the producers thought it would be fun to have him back on the show. After he stumped the panel he presented each of the three panelists who were on the show when he first appeared (\'Arlene Francis\' (qv), \'Bennett Cerf (I)\' (qv) and \'Dorothy Kilgallen\' (qv)) buttons with their pictures on them as they looked ten years earlier. Arlene said, ""I was a brunette then.""'
 ""'Grace Stafford' (qv), the voice of Woody Woodpecker, appeared on the November 10, 1963 broadcast as a contestant in the regular game.""
 ""On the October 2, 1960 broadcast, the heads of both the Democratic and Republican National Committees appeared on the show together as mystery guests: 'Henry Jackson (I)' (qv) (DNC) and 'Thruston B. Morton' (qv) (RNC). The episode never has been revived on the basic cable channel GSN as of November 2014. Bloggers who have watched hundreds of episodes say they suspect this particular kinescope was destroyed. It would be among many kinescopes that do not survive.""
 ""The mystery guest on the final CBS broadcast was 'John Daly (I)' (qv). Producers 'Mark Goodson (I)' (qv) and 'Bill Todman' (qv) appeared in the closing moments of the half-hour to thank the public for its long support of the program. They had appeared on-camera a few times over the years. Goodson had appeared on-camera with Frank Sinatra nine months earlier. The finale was telecast live on September 3, 1967 immediately following a long summer vacation during which CBS had telecast videotapes that the show had stockpiled earlier in 1967.""
 'Although the final 1966 to 1967 season was broadcast in color, the color videotapes were discarded by CBS. Only black and white kinescope copies of the show were saved for posterity. Thus, we will never see color episodes of this show on GSN, only the b & w versions, which at that time, is what most viewers saw, as over half of the US population did not have color sets.'
 ""The show was broadcast outside of New York only twice in its 17 1/2-year history. The first time was on August 12, 1956 when it emanated from Chicago where 'John Daly (I)' (qv) was covering the Democratic National Convention for ABC News and 'Dorothy Kilgallen' (qv) was reporting on it for the Hearst newspaper chain. The second was on January 12, 1958 which originated from CBS Television City in Hollywood, for which a special panel of 'Laraine Day' (qv), 'Mickey Rooney (I)' (qv), 'Esther Williams (I)' (qv) and 'Jack Lemmon' (qv) was assembled in place of the regulars.""
 'The German version of this program was named _""Was bin ich?"" (1955)_ (qv), which translates to ""What am I?"" in English.'
 'The French Canadian version of this program was named _""Chacun son métier"" (1954)_ (qv), which translates from French to English as ""To Each His Job."" This French-speaking version was aired in Canada from 1954 to 1959.'
 'On the February 9, 1964 broadcast one of the contestants was a man who made Beatle wigs. In a display of visual graphics that was rare for the series, a publicity shot of the Fab Four was flashed on screen immediately after the man\'s line was revealed to viewers. \'The Beatles\' (qv) were making their historic first appearance that same night on _""Toast of the Town"" (1948)_ (qv) at a nearby TV studio. During the opening introductions on this broadcast, Kilgallen introduced \'Bennett Cerf (I)\' (qv) as "" \'What\'s My Line\'s answer to the Beatles."" Cerf then introduced ""John \'Ringo\' Daly."" Then Daly kidded Cerf, at the time 65 years old, about his youthful interest in the group from Liverpool. Although none of the Beatles ever appeared on this series, their manager \'Brian Epstein (I)\' (qv) did on October 18, 1964, less than three years before his death.'
 ""Although there are those who suspect 'John Daly (I)' (qv) was sending the panel signals, Moderator Daly insisted that there is only one signal he ever gave to the panel: When he pulled his right ear lobe it warned them, usually 'Hal Block (I)' (qv), that the questions were getting dangerously close to double entendre.""
 'Among the approximately 5,000 letters received by the Goodson company each week, many protested \'Dorothy Kilgallen\' (qv)\'s relentless onslaught. Many took issue with the puns \'Hal Block (I)\' (qv) would slip into his earnest questions. Many of those who claimed they could puzzle the panel with their occupations enclosed with their letters irreplaceable old photographs. Sometimes a package arrived containing an 8 X 10 wedding portrait in a glass frame. These viewers ignored \'John Daly (I)\' (qv)\'s on-air plea that they should send ""a snapshot that you can spare. It can\'t be returned. Too many come in.""'
 ""A ''What's My Line?'' board game was introduced in the fall of 1955.""
 'Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan each appeared on the show before becoming president, but there never was a president who went on the show while in office. \'Lyndon Johnson (I)\' (qv) used the show shortly after the JFK assassination to advertise his liberal stand on the civil rights movement. When Johnson took over the White House, he requested a new slate of secretaries. He saw Geraldine Whittington working in another U.S. government agency and requested that his special assistant \'Jack Valenti\' (qv) get her home phone number. Johnson called her unannounced one evening and requested that she come in that night for an interview. According to audiotapes of Johnson\'s phone calls, Whittington at first thought the call was a joke but came to believe that it really was the president on the line. She applied for the position and got it. Having a black woman in the White House was very unusual in 1964. Johnson wanted to advertise the fact that he\'d hired a black woman but chose not to call a news conference. Instead, he arranged for Whittington to appear on ""What\'s My Line,"" where \'Bennett Cerf (I)\' (qv) and \'Dorothy Kilgallen\' (qv) figured out her line of work. This may have seemed less overt but probably exposed her to more viewers than if a standard press conference had been held. The LBJ Library in Austin, Texas has a White House telephone log from January 19, 1964, the night Whittington was in New York doing the show, but the log says erroneously that the president made a long distance call to the ""I\'ve Got A Secret"" studio to check on his secretary. Whittington died of cancer in 1993 without knowing that her live TV appearance would be revived on the Game Show Network.'
 ""None of the panelists that were on the panel the night of the series finale ('Arlene Francis' (qv), 'Bennett Cerf (I)' (qv), 'Steve Allen (I)' (qv) and 'Martin Gabel' (qv)) were on the panel the night the series debuted in 1950.""
 'From 1950-1967 all episodes of ""What\'s My Line"" were recorded on kinescope (film). In 1959 videotape was first introduced as the method to prerecord episodes so Goodson Todman Productions could stockpile them for vacations that their employees and the show\'s performers could take in the future. The company reused the same Ampex videotapes over and over. The company paid CBS to make kinescopes of the prerecorded episodes as well as the live ones. Ampex videotape was too expensive to use as a permanent record of a broadcast. Its most important use was to allow people who worked on weekly game shows to take vacations in the summer and for Christmas and New Years Eve. As of 2009 an American basic cable channel called GSN telecasts ten episodes of the series every December. An astute viewer can use the Internet to identify the year that the episode aired live or was videotaped.'
 'On November 9, 1952, a year after the premiere of _""I Love Lucy"" (1951)_ (qv), \'Desi Arnaz\' (qv) was the mystery guest. His wife Lucille Ball did not appear with him at that time. While Arlene Francis was blindfolded, she identified him. Arnaz appeared as a guest panelist once: February 5, 1956. His wife appeared on the series many times without him. After their 1960 divorce, only she appeared. He did not.'
 ""For the program's entire seventeen year run, the top prize was fifty dollars. The network and the producers wanted to make the top prize one thousand dollars. Some staff members balked at the notion and threatened to quit fearing the change would alter the tone of the game so the plan was abandoned.""
 'Starting with the live broadcast on July 20, 1952, Goodson-Todman Productions paid CBS for each kinescope, so the network never again destroyed the show. But Goodson-Todman eventually destroyed some telecasts and portions of other telecasts.'
 'It is true that for seventeen years CBS recorded every broadcast of this series on kinescope film. Many episodes were lost to history, however, during two time periods that were far apart. In 1950, CBS saved kinescopes of the first three telecasts at a financial loss to the network. They are available for viewing on a web site. At the time, the show aired live every other week, not every week. The kinescope process used silver nitrate film, which was flammable. But fire was not the reason why many broadcasts of ""What\'s My Line"" were lost during the period of 1950 to 1952. CBS employees discovered an advantage of the expensive silver nitrate film. They learned that it was possible to recover the silver content from the film and sell it. CBS did this many times starting with the fourth show, which the network had aired live on March 16, 1950. A publication called TV Digest based in Philadelphia reported that blindfolded panelist Hal Block had asked the mystery guest a question about her clothing. To Block\'s surprise, this got a laugh because the mystery guest, unknown to him, was stripper \'Gypsy Rose Lee\' (qv). But their exchange has not been heard since 1950, and will not be heard again, due to the loss of the kinescope. Starting with the live telecast of July 20, 1952, the Goodson-Todman company paid CBS for each kinescope, so the network never again destroyed the show. Eventually, safety film replaced the silver nitrate. Twenty years after the first period of destruction, employees of Goodson-Todman were responsible for accidentally destroying sixteen kinescopes while they compiled clips for a 25th anniversary special. They were working at an expensive editing facility in Manhattan under a strict deadline. Five of the sixteen ruined shows dated from 1967.'
 'Another missing gem is Dorothy Kilgallen\'s introduction of guest panelist \'Woody Allen\' (qv) on the live telecast from July 7, 1963. As she arrives at the panelists\' desk, the kinescope film jumps ahead to Allen saying that he ""recently"" had a wet dream about Arlene Francis whom he is introducing. ""She did great [in the wet dream]."" When Francis reaches her seat, she says, ""Why didn\'t you tell me before, Woody?"" Gil Fates and his three colleagues evidently considered using Kilgallen\'s amusing introduction of Allen in the 1975 anniversary retrospective, discarded it while their deadline was fast approaching and never put it back in the kinescope. Much later during the same kinescope, Allen can be heard asking contestant Jeanette Kraus, a Chicago resident who sells lobsters, if her product is ""rich and, um, so sumptuous as to make one, say, nauseated if eaten like at 6:00 in the morning."" That does appear in the 1975 anniversary program.'

In March and early April 1975, they were working at an expensive editing facility in Manhattan under a strict deadline. Five of the sixteen shows that were totally ruined dated from 1967. Some humorous snippets were removed from kinescopes and did not end up in the special. They have been lost, leaving GSN viewers to puzzle over several reruns that have obvious splices in the scratchy film, and some spoken words are missing. The 25th anniversary special is available for viewing if one visits the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills, California.""
 'The 25th anniversary special is available for viewing on a web site and also at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills. It includes a snippet that is missing from a GSN rerun because Gil Fates and his three colleagues never put it back in the kinescope for the live telecast of July 7, 1963. \'Woody Allen\' (qv), making his first appearance as a guest panelist, can be heard asking contestant Jeanette Kraus, a Chicago resident who sells lobsters, if her product is ""rich and, um, so sumptuous as to make one, say, nauseated if eaten like at 6:00 in the morning."" The anniversary special does not include a snippet that is lost: Dorothy Kilgallen\'s introduction of Allen toward the beginning of the same telecast. As she arrives at the panelists\' desk, the kinescope film jumps ahead to Allen saying that he ""recently"" had a wet dream about Arlene Francis whom he is introducing.'
 'In January 2016, the kinescope of a lost episode was discovered on eBay. It was bought and uploaded to YouTube on January 24, 2016 by a WML preserver.'
 'This version of ""What\'s My Line?"" held the record for the longest-running game show on American television (17 years, 7 months) for many years. It was surpassed by _""The New Price Is Right"" (1972)_ (qv), which debuted in September 1972 and is still on the air as of 2016.'
 'When Mystery Guests were on, Dorthy Kilgallen was the one who normally figured out foreigners, because her journalist style allowed her to figure out the length of time it took a person to answer questions. One of the most noticeable examples is when Austrian beauty Hedy Lamarr was on, her first appearance on the show, and she left the panel stumped. Dorothy made a reference, to the other panelists, she knew the woman did not speak English as her native language, because her answers were coming in too slow for a native speaker.'

It all began six months ago in Europe when FBI counterespionage agents Mel Hunter and his partner, Bill Winters, infiltrated a secret missile launching site behind the Iron Curtain. During an experiment to test a new type of fuel, one of the rockets blew up. Mel was in exposure radius of the blast. At first the exact nature of his illness was not known; he seemed simply to be sufi^ering from shock, accompanied by a loss of appetite. Bill managed to get Mel back to the States when it started to happen: some unknown ingredient in the rocket fuel began to affect Mel's molecular structure. Fourteen doctors and 17 scientists watched as Mel began to shrink. In less than a month, Mel was reduced to a height of six inches. While his physical appearance remained the same, a medical report stated that he now possesses ""superhuman manual dexterity coupled with agility and reflexes many times faster than normal: somewhere between a hummingbird and a mongoose."" Mel is the first such case known to medical history and has scientists stumped; they are unable to determine what ingredient caused the shrinkage or how to reverse the process. Thus Mel's condition is classified top secret. ""The problem is to keep him classified and alive,"" says Commissioner H.G. Hall, Mel and Bill's superior (whom they call ""Chief""). Mel was originally six feet two inches tall; he is now six inches tall and lives with Bill in Apartment  3B at 37 Lynley Drive in Washington, D.C. Things most people wouldn't notice (such as a pencil falling off a desk) could mean death for Mel. He has to be careful 3,600 seconds of every hour.

 Yancy Derringer. ,Series, Adventure, CBS," The setting is New Orleans, Louisiana, inl868. Yancy Derringer, a former Confederate soldier and the owner of a riverboat and plantation, volunteers to help city administrator John Colton institute a system of law and order. Stories relate that aspect. Yancy is assisted by a non-speaking Pawnee Indian named Pahoo-Ka-Ta-Wah (""Wolf Who Stands in Water""). (Pahoo saved Yancy's life at some point within the last eight years. He went against his faith saving a white man and is now responsible for Yancy's life.) Pahoo carries a shotgun with him at all times. The only background information on Yancy is that he was born in New Orleans. He left in 1860, joined the Confederacy, was shot during the Battle of Cold Harbor and spent one year in a Yankee prison. When he got out (possibly in 1865), he went out West to strike it rich but didn't (it was probably at this time that Pahoo saved Yancy's life). Yancy then returned to Louisiana to pick up where he left off. Old Dixie is Yancy's dog, the Sultana is his river-boat and Waverly Plantation is the place of his birth and is his home. Yancy indeed carries a derringer, in his hat, up his sleeve, in his belt and in his boot. He owns a silver mine in Virginia City, Nevada, and buys his fancy ""duds"" at Devereaux's Gentlemen's Apparel. Mme. Francine is Yancy's love interest; Mai Ling Mandarin, Yancy's friend, runs the Sazarack Restaurant; and Captain Billy is the skipper of the Sultana. The Central Pacific Railroad was mentioned as laying track in New Orleans.

Theme: ""Yancy Derringer,"" by Don Quinn and Henry Russell. Cast: Jock Mahoney {Yancy Derringer), X Brands {Pahoo), Kevin Hagen {John Colton), Frances Bergen {Mme.

 ""Yancy Derringer, an ex-Confederate soldier turned gambler, was a suave lady's man in New Orleans, Louisiana. In reality, he was working for John Colton, the civil administrator of the city. Yancy's job was to prevent crime and if necessary, arrest the culprits. His constant companion was Pahoo-Ka-Ta-Wah an Indian who watches Yancy's back.""
 'Yancy usually (always?) wore a mechanism on his forearm under his shirt sleeve that had a ""quick-draw"" derringer attached. When activated, it would quickly push the derringer down his sleeve and into his hand--ready to fire. I believe that he also carried a fashionable cane that contained a derringer in the handle.'
 'It should be noted that Yancy\'s last name is ""Derringer"" whereas the famous small pistol was named for its inventor, Henry Deringer Jr. Yancy points out the difference in spelling and states there is no relationship between the family named Derringer and the family named Deringer in at least two different episodes. Sharp eyed viewers may notice that Jock Mahoney favored moccasins or other footwear without heels.

 ""You Bet Your Life was taken from Groucho's radio series of the same name. It was inspired after Groucho had done an improvisational scene with 'Bob Hope (I)' (qv) on radio. The idea was the same as it later was with 'Bill Cosby' (qv): to invite people on and have an unrehearsed conversation with them.

 ""Usually a prop duck came down on a cable with the prize money when the secret word was spoken. On one occasion however, 'Groucho Marx' (qv)'s brother, 'Harpo Marx' (qv), came down instead.""
 ""Although the popular impression is that 'Groucho Marx' (qv) entirely improvised his jokes, in reality the show also had gag writers who interviewed the contestants beforehand and prepared questions and comments for Groucho to use in addition to his own improvisations. To feed them to him subtly, a Tele-Score bowling alley projector located stage left and out of camera range was used.""

 ""Reportedly, the reason why this show was prerecorded for broadcast was because the network was afraid that 'Groucho Marx' (qv)'s ad-libs would run afoul of the censors. In reality, another reason was to condense the interviews to fit the allotted time with the most entertaining material Groucho was able to generate with them.""
 'It is part of Hollywood legend that one of the source recordings for the ""laugh track"" sounds heard on sitcoms since the 1960s originated from a particularly long bit of laughter that erupted during an episode of this series.'

 Zorro. ,Series, Adventure, ABC," Spanish California in 1820 is the setting. On a ship bound for Old Los Angeles, Don Diego de la Vega, a Spanish nobleman, is returning home to Monterey after three years of study at the University of Spain. He has been summoned by his father, Don Alejandro, to help fight a tyrant, the new comandante, Enrique Monasterio, who has imposed harsh laws and taxes on the people in his quest to become the richest man in California. In his cabin aboard ship, Don Diego tells his mute servant Bernardo that he must find a way to deal with Monasterio without arousing suspicion that his father has summoned him home. Bernardo uses sign language to suggest force _æ ""No, Bernardo. I'm dealing with a powerful enemy. We must play another game."" Just then Don Diego recalls a proverb: ""When you cannot clothe yourself in the skin of a lion, put on that of a fox. I must convince the new comandante that I am perfectly harmless. Instead ofa man of action, I shall be a man of letters, an innocent scholar interested only in the arts and sciences."" With his plan half organized, Don Diego then devises his secret alias, the man who will fight Monasterio _æ ""Zorro _æ the Fox."" He then chooses a black mask and outfit to disguise his true identity. However, to make his plan work, he must also conceal his secret identity from his father. The de la Vegas are the most important family in southern California. Zorro's base is a secret cave below his hacienda in Monterey. Zorro rides a black horse named Tornado and his trademark is the carved sign of the Z. While Zorro is an expert marksman, Don Diego pretends to be inexperienced at fencing. To further cover his tracks as Zorro, Diego teaches Bernardo to play the guitar (to make it appear that Don Diego is in his room practicing when in reality he is out battling injustice as Zorro). Although Zorro helps people, he is considered a criminal by the authorities. Zorro, ""a friend of the people,"" is ""the defender of the oppressed"" and ""the champion of justice."" After battling Monasterio for several months, Zorro finds a new enemy when Enrique is found to be corrupt by the Viceroy (John Dehner) and arrested. Captain Arturo PoUidano, the new magistrate, replaces him and vows to bring the criminal Zorro to justice. Sergeant Demetrio Lopez Garcia is the bumbling second in command, a soldier of the IGng's lancers (he replaces Arturo in second season episodes). Cresencia is the de la Vega maid; Anna Maria Verdugo is Don Diego's romantic interest; Ricardo Delano is Don Diego's rival for Anna Maria's hand. Senor Esteban de la Cruz (Cesar Romero) is Don Diego's playboy uncle on his mother's side; Lt. Rafael Santos (Carlos Romero) is another ""bad man"" who plagued Zorro; Ignacio ""Nacio"" Torres (Jan Arvan) is Don Diego's neighbor; Elena Torres (Eugenia Paul) is Ignacio's daughter; Father Felipe (Joseph Calleia) is the padre at the Mission de San Gabriel. In addition to 78 half-hour episodes (1957-59), four one hour programs were produced and aired on Walt Disney Presents on the following dates: October  30, 1960 (""El Bandito""), November 6, 1960 (""Adios el CuchiUo""), January 1, 1961 (""The Postponed Wedding"") and April 2, 1961 (""Auld Acquaintance"").

 'Although ""Zorro"" was the most popular show in its Thursday evening slot, the series was pulled in 1959 due to legal wrangling between the Disney Studios and the ABC network.

 Mr. and Mrs. North. ,Series, Crime Drama," CBS, NBC"," ""To Jerry, with Love, Pam,"" is the inscription on the pocket watch Pamela North gave to her husband, Gerald (""Jerry"") North, on the occasion of their first wedding anniversary. (They have been married five years when the series begins. Pam and Jerry married on a Friday afternoon during Pam's lunch hour and honeymooned in Paris.) Jerry, a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II, is a former private detective who relinquished the rough life for a peaceful existence as a publisher (for an unidentified house). Pamela is young, beautiful and fashion conscious, and she believes she possesses the mind of a detective (when she sees something that is wrong, she immediately associates it with foul play). Much to Jerry's regret, Pam is most often right and he finds himself playing detective again to solve a crime. It is unfair to give Jerry all the credit. Pam does solve crimes on her own. She is so unassuming that the culprit is unaware of her brilliance and is caught by surprise. Pam is extremely proud of herself at these moments and tells Jerry, ""If I hadn't used my brains, I'd be dead. You'd have a corpse for a wife."" (Unfortunately, Pam tells Jerry this when he is trying to sleep or is involved with a manuscript; the remark falls virtually on deaf ears _æ ""Yes, honey, that's nice, dear."" Occasionally, Jerry's subconscioushears what Pam is saying. When he reahzes what she said, he shows great concern and tells her not to do it again. She agrees _æ until the next episode.) Jerry and Pam live at 24 Sainte Anne's Place, Apartment 6A, in New York's Greenwich Village. (Their address is also given as 23 Sainte Anne's Place, Apartment 408 _æ even though Apartment 6A is seen in the opening theme.) Their closest friend is Bill Weigand, a lieutenant with the Homicide Division of the Police Department of New York City (he was best man at their wedding). The series is based on the novel by Frances and Richard Lockridge. See also the two prior titles. Cast: Richard Denning {Jerry North), Barbara Britton {Pamela North), Francis DeSales {Bill Weigand).
