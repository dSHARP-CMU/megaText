Mike, one of the earliest of the TV detectives, is based on the movie detectives who preceded him (like Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade). He is hardboiled and two fisted.

931, Captain Video and His Video Rangers. ,Series, Science Fiction, DuMont," On June 27, 1949, a daily series called Captain Video premiered in New York City on the DuMont network's flagship station, WABD-TV, channel 5. It was simply a showcase for old western theatrical films with Captain Video serving as the host. As the network began to grow, the format was changed to focus on a crime fighter known as ""The Guardian of the Safety of the World."" The Captain was given an assistant, the Video Ranger and the program opened with these words over Wagner's ""Flying Dutchman Overture"": ""Master of Space! Hero of Science! Captain of the Video Rangers! Operating from his secret mountain headquarters on the planet Earth, Captain Video rallies men of goodwill everywhere. As he rockets from planet to planet, let us follow the champion of truth, justice and freedom throughout the universe. Stand by for Captain Video and His Video Rangers."" Only a handful of Captain Video episodes appear to exist; press release information is very scarce; and the pre-national TV Guide, TV Forecast, is extremely sketchy. It is difficult to determine when in 1949 the new Captain Video format emerged and when the words ""and His Video Rangers"" were added to the title. At this time, and until 1951, Jack Orsen played the Captain's superior, Commissioner Bell. In 1951 (and until 1957) Al Hodge took over the role of Captain Video (from Richard Coogan); Ben Lackland became Commission Carey, the Captain's new superior, from 1951 until 1955. The evil Dr. Pauli also became a regular at this time. Hoping to cash in on the show's popularity, DuMont added a Saturday morning version of the series called The Secret Files of Captain Video (9/5/53-5/29/54). Although that original DuMont station is still broadcasting in New York (now WNYW) it has no records of its time as a DuMont station. The TV ForecastYisim^s were mostly generic, listing only the series title; if program information was given, it was the star or a statement (for example, ""Scientific adventures in the world of the future"").

It is possible, however, to determine that the Saturday shows were complete in one episode, not serialized adventures characteristic of the daily series. On March 28, 1955, the daily series came to an end. On July 10, 1955, the format changed again; it was now an hour-long series wherein Captain Video was the host to old theatrical serials and movies. On September 25, 1955, Captain Video was incorporated into Wonder Time, a six-hour series that ran from noon to 6:00 P.M. Sandy Becker served as the host and Al Hodge, as Captain Video, hosted a series of cartoons and documentaries. On August 16,  1957, Captain Video ended with the demise of the DuMont network. The series itself was set in the future (the 21st then  22nd centuries).

 'Set in the 22nd century, there were 51+ serialized stories in all, totaling 1,537 episodes. The show was 30 minutes in length, but for the first few years approximately half of the program consisted of serialized excerpts from old B-Westerns. Thes segments were supposed to depict Video\'s ""agents"". Eventually - likely by Summer, 1952 - these clips were phased out in favor of full length Captain Video adventures. In mid-September, 1953, the program reverted to a 15 minutes running time. Until late in 1950 there was no Wednesday episode, but it was seen on Saturday. (NOTE: This statement is questionable.) By 1951, the series\' level of sophistication had become much more finely-honed. Scripts came from top science-fiction writers and consultants, and many Broadway stage actors were cast. At its peak, over 125 stations carried the series, including many non-DuMont affiliates. The first TV-to-Hollywood spin-off, a 15-chapter serial from Columbia Pictures (_Captain Video, Master of the Stratosphere (1951)_ (qv) with a different cast), came from this program in 1951, and a Saturday-morning TV series (_""The Secret Files of Captain Video"" (1953)_ (qv)) began in 1953. However, despite the program\'s immense popularity, the DuMont network\'s insurmountable problems caused it to cease operations by 1955. While other DuMont programs were continued on other networks, DuMont refused to sell ""Captain Video"" to NBC, and \'Al Hodge\' (qv) returned as the Captain to host a local cartoon/documentary film series over New York station WABD, the former DuMont flagship. DuMont\'s television archive was destroyed by a successor after it\'s collapse. The total number of stories is probably closer to 100, and the episodes may number higher than 1,537, but remaining information only accounts for 51 stories.'

 'During the Vietnam War, American soldiers who were taken as Prisoners of War by the North Vietnamese were often interrogated and asked whom the American military leaders were. Reportedly, several POWs would respond with ""Captain Video."" The North Vietnamese interrogators, being extremely gullible, accepted this answer.

When the war ended, the small base used as the Flying Tigers' headquarters was abandoned. Shortly after, Hu Fang, the evil leader of the Hill Bandits, joins with a group of renegade pilots called the Flame Dragons and sets out to conquer Kunsang.

71, Space Patrol. ,Series, Adventure, ABC," The Space Patrol is a 30th century organization that is responsible for the safety of the United Planets (Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Venus). The United Planets measure seven and one third billion miles in diameter. The Space Patrol is based on the manmade city of Terra and is not only responsible for protecting the United Planets from alien invaders, but keeping the space lanes safe for travel. Major ""Robbie"" Robertson is the Security Chief for the United Planets; Buzz Corry is the commander of the Space Patrol and its chief operative(tackling dangerous missions in the cause of universal freedom) . He is assisted by Cadet Happy, Tonga and Carol Carlisle. Buzz succeeded his brother, Kit Corry as the chief of the Space Patrol shortly after the series began. Buzz is fascinated by Carnacan history (a lost civilization of the planet Mars) and is quick to take action in any situation to save his shipmates. His first ship was the Battle Cruiser 100; this was replaced by the Terra IVznd finally the Terra V. Cadet Happy, the winner of the Corry Scholarship (set up by Buzz's family) is a recent graduate of the Space Patrol Academy and served as Buzz's co-pilot. He is easygoing, a bit inexperienced and always ready for a fight. His hobby is photography and ""holy smokin' rockets"" is his favorite saying (which he utters when something goes wrong). Tonga, a criminal before being reformed, is now a Space Patrol ally (she previously robbed passengers on sightseeing ships). She works as the assistant to the Security Chief (Major Robertson) and often joins Buzz and his associates on assignments (in some episodes Tonga is said to be the secretary to the Secretary of the United Planets). Carol is the daughter of the Security General of the United Planets. She is a brilliant scientist and inventor of the Agra-Ray, a device that brings plants to full maturity in a matter of hours; however, if used in reverse, the ray can turn cities into stone. Carol and Tonga, while supposed to be ""the weaker sex,"" were in no way depicted as such. While their uniforms were designed to show their legs for a bit of ""cheesecake,"" they were capable of defending themselves (but were most often depicted as ""girls in distress"" who needed rescuing by Buzz). Major Robertson was quick to act but often questioned his decisions and worried about the consequences of his actions. He also invented the formula for the Zeta Ray, a machine that cures any illness and halts the spread of infection. Prince Baccarratti, also known as the Black Falcon, is an evil alien, based in his castle on Planet X, who sought to rule the United Planets by destroying the Space Patrol. Mr. Proteus, the man of many faces, was also a threat to Buzz and his crew. Agent X and Major Sova were also enemies of the United Planets. Space Patrol premiered locally in Los Angeles on KECA-TV on March 13, 1950, as a 15-minute daily serial. This was followed by a 30-minute Saturday morning network series that ran from December 30, 1950 to February 26, 1955. Both were distributed to affiliated stations by kinescope. KECA dropped the daily shows from national distribution when the cost of film and shipping became excessive. The daily shows now aired only in Los Angeles while the Saturday morning shows were still being seen elsewhere (about a week later) by kinescope (making a copy of a live TV show by photographing it off a moni-tor). By late 1952, when the coaxial cable permitted coast-to-coast transmission, the live Saturday shows were no longer kinescoped; the daily series was dropped. Jack Narz is the announcer; the program opens with these words: ""High adventure in the wild, vast regions of space. Missions of daring in the name of interplanetary justice.

100," Tom Corbett, Space Cadet. ",Series, Adventure," CBS, NBC, ABC, DuMont"," It is the year 2350 and the planets Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Venus have been colonized. They are part of the Solar Alliance and protected by the Solar Guards, a celestial police force that is based at Space Academy, U.S.A., a training school for aspiring Solar Guards. Space Academy itself enlists men of high school and college age to train as Solar Guards. While not readily explained, women are not permitted to become Solar Guards. They can, however, train as Auxiliary Cadets to assist Solar Guards in times of emergency. Stories follow the adventures of Solar Guards Tom Corbett, Astro and Roger Manning. Major Ben Connell, called ""Blastoff"" by the cadets, is the roughest, toughest and meanest officer in the Solar Guards, while Dr. Joan Dale, is the kindest of instructors at Space Academy. Tom, Roger and Astro are assigned to training on the Polaris. While supposedly only a cadet, Tom appeared to be more of an academy official (he gave orders, charted flights and booked space maneuvers). He was strong and forceful and showed leadership quality. He was also quick thinking, assertive and popular with all those he worked with. Early episodes find Tom as the storyteller. He is seated in an official-looking office and welcomes viewers to relate an adventure he shared with Roger and Astro. A flashback-type of sequence is used and Tom returns at the end of the story to relate the moral and bid farewell with his famous ""So long for now and spaceman's luck to all of you."" Astro was the alien member of the team. He was born to Teron parents on the planet Venus (at a time when it was just being colonized) and is considered to be a Venusian by his colleagues. He is a naturalborn engineer and his job is to oversee the rocket motors on the power deck of the Polaris. Astro has a quick temper and frequently acts without thinking first. Roger is a wise guy, sarcastic and always causing trouble (especially with his habit of playing practical jokes). He often taunts Astro and causes endless rifts between them. While he did work on the radar bridge (near the nose of the Polaris) he also thoughthe was better than everyone else (boasting of his own accomplishments while downgrading those of his colleagues). Why Roger was not expelled is a mystery, but in time of dire need he became helpful (but in the end he would always give into temptation and belittle others). He was replaced in last season episodes by Cadet T.J. Thistle, a non-practical jokeplaying student who had a chip on his shoulder (he felt his short height prevented him from achieving success). Dr. Joan Dale was the only regular female presence at the academy. She was a professional and dedicated to teaching. Joan was not a femme fatale (a girl always in need of rescuing). She was beautiful, educated, intelligent and capable of defending herself. Joan was also a researcher and inventor. She created Tom's rocket-powered space suit as well as a new rocket fuel and the Hyper Drive (which allowed the Solar Guards' rocket cruisers to reach nearby stars). Joan was not all work. She had a human side and would worry about her superior, Captain Steve Strong and Tom's crew when they were off on dangerous missions. Commander Arkwright was the stern principal of Space Academy; Cadet Eric Rattison headed the crew of the Vega; Rex Marshall appeared as Lieutenant Saunders in commercials for the show's longtime sponsor, Kellogg's Cereals (it was also sponsored by Kraft Foods and Red Goose shoes). Announcer Jackson Beck opened early episodes with these words: ""Space Academy, U.S.A., in the world beyond tomorrow. Here the space cadets train for duty on distant planets. In roaring rockets they blast through the millions of miles from Earth to far flung stars and brave the dangers of cosmic frontiers, protecting the liberties of the planets, safeguarding the cause of universal peace in the conquest of space.""

 'The Adventures of Cyclone Malone was essentially a puppet show take on The Perils of Pauline. Presented in traditional cliffhanger fashion, the show followed danger-seeking hero Cyclone Malone as he attempted to rescue his sweetheart Cosy from the clutches of such villains as The Lizard.

4, The Adventures of Superman. ,Series, Adventure, Syn.," As the theme music (written by Leon Klatzkin) plays, an announcer begins the program: ""Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" Voices are then heard: ""Look, up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's Superman."" The announcer returns: ""Yes, it's Superman, strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands. And who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fightsa never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American Way."" But who is Superman _æ and where did he come from? The story begins many years ago on a distant planet called Krypton, which is inhabited by a race of super intelligent beings. Jor-El (Robert Rockwell) is a leading scientist who believes the planet is being drawn closer to its sun and destruction. When he is unable to convince the Council of Scientists of his beliefs, he begins developing a rocket ship to save his wife, Lara (Aline Towne) and their infant son, Kal-El, from the impending disaster. Jor-El, however, has only time to complete a small, experimental rocket before the planet is struck by earthquakes. He and Lara decide to save Kal-El. The baby is placed in the rocket and Jor-El programs it to land on Earth, a planet he knows is inhabited. Shortly after the rocket is launched. Krypton explodes and scatters billions of particles of Kryptonite, the only substance that will be able to harm Kal-El, into the universe. The rocket enters the Earth's atmosphere on April  10, 1926, and crash lands near the Jones farm in Smallville, Kansas. Eben and Sarah Kent (Tom Fadden, Dina Nolan), a childless farm couple, witness the landing. Eben risks his life to save the baby from the burning rocket. The baby, wrapped in red and blue blankets, is miraculously unharmed. The rocket explodes seconds later, destroying all evidence of its ever having been there. Realizing that no one would ever believe their fantastic story, Eben and Sarah decide to raise the baby as their own and name him Clark Kent. As young Clark (Stuart Randall) begins to grow, he develops amazing powers (X-ray vision, incredible strength, the ability to fly). In 1951, following Eben's death from a heart attack, Sarah urges Clark to use his great abilities to help mankind. Before Sarah moves in with her cousin, Louise, she makes Clark a costume from the blankets that were originally wrapped around him (how she managed to cut and sew the indestructible material was not explained). To keep his true identity a secret, he maintains the alias of mild-mannered Clark Kent and moves to Metropolis, where he becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, a crusading newspaper. Clark lives in Apartment 5H of the Standish Arms Hotel. While it appeared that Sarah had made only one costume for Clark in the pilot (""Superman on Earth""), later episodes show that Clark has three Superman costumes in his secret closet (located behind a false wall in his regular closet). Lois Lane is the Daily Planet reporter always in distress. She was born in the small town of Cliftonby-the-Sea and now lives in Apartment 6A. She suspects that Clark is Superman but can't prove it (she believes that every time Clark disappears in an emergency to become Superman, he is a coward _æ ""Looking for a hole to hide in, Clark?""). Jimmy Olsen was originally depicted as the paper's photographer, then a cub reporter. He has the middle name of Bartholomew and lives with his mother in an undisclosed location. Like Lois, he too faces perilous situations and must be rescued by Superman. Perry White is the editor of the Daily Planet. He was a top notch reporter, then the mayor of Metropolis before becoming editor. ""Great Caesar's Ghost"" is the expression Perry uses when he becomes upset or angry; and ""Don't Call Me Chief!"" is what he yells at Jimmy for constantly calling him ""Chief."" William ""Bill"" Henderson is the police inspector who is most helped by Superman. Professor Twiddle (Sterling HoUoway) and Professor J.J. Pepperwinkle (Phillips Tead) are slightly off-center scientists who complicate Clark's life with their wacky inventions. The series is based on the comic strip by Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster.

 'In episode #1.1 _""Adventures of Superman"" (1952) {Superman on Earth (#1.1)}_ (qv), a number of the costumes worn in the Krypton sequences were cannibalized from ones used in 1940s serials which were comic strip and comic book adaptations. The costume that Jor-El, Superman\'s father is the same one that \'Buster Crabbe\' (qv) wore in the serial _Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940)_ (qv). Other Kryptonians wore parts of the costumes of Captain Marvel (from _Adventures of Captain Marvel (1941)_ (qv)) and Captain America (from _Captain America (1944)_ (qv)) among others.'
 'It is now common knowledge that Clark Kent\'s Earth parents were named Jonathan and Martha. However, in the first episode, _""Adventures of Superman"" (1952) {Superman on Earth (#1.1)}_ (qv), Kent\'s parents were named Eben and Sarah. This is because the comics themselves were inconsistent with the Kents\' given names until the characters became major players in ""Superboy"" comics stories at about this same time. The names Sarah and Eben were first used in the novel ""The Adventures of Superman"" (1942) and in the first Superman serial.'

 ""When the series was picked up by Kellogg's, the breakfast cereal manufacturer, some of the cast members were able to make extra money by appearing in Kellogg's commercials. This did not include 'Phyllis Coates' (qv) or 'Noel Neill' (qv). It was felt that Lois Lane having breakfast with Clark Kent was too suggestive.""
 'An often talked-about mistake in the show is that Superman would duck when a thug would throw his empty gun at him. While this mistake is often attributed to \'George Reeves (I)\' (qv) not wanting to be hit by a prop gun, it was actually George\'s stunt double \'Dale Van Sickel\' (qv) who ducked. This mistake actually only happened once, in _""Adventures of Superman"" (1952) {The Mind Machine (#1.8)}_ (qv)). If you watch the fight scene closely, you can see that a stunt double is used some of the time and that it is that double who ducked. The fan group for the Adventures of Superman (The Adventures Continue) has published more details about Van Sickle making this mistake.'
 ""The Superman costume was padded to make it appear that 'George Reeves (I)' (qv) had greater bulk. However, Reeves himself did most of the stunts, which required impressive athletic ability including jumping from substantial heights (to simulate Superman landing in the frame), hitting a springboard with sufficient force to propel him out of frame (to simulate Superman taking off in flight), swinging through windows, and hours spent doing wire work and being in a body support platform to create the scenes of Superman flying.""
 ""In the early seasons, wire work was used to create some of the flying scenes. During the course of this work there had been some minor mishaps, but on one occasion the support wires snapped, causing 'George Reeves (I)' (qv) to be dropped to the floor. Reeves refused to do anymore wire work. This is why episodes in the early seasons would show Superman taking off in flight within the frame. But, in later seasons, he would run toward the camera, hit a springboard hidden below frame and leap out of frame.""
 'The train seen in the opening sequence for the first two seasons is a streamline steam locomotive. Starting with the third season, which was filmed in color, a modern diesel locomotive was seen instead.'

 'For the first season of the series, the E. Clem Wilson Building in Los Angeles was used for the exterior shots of the Daily Planet. Throughout the rest of the series, the building seen as the Daily Planet Building is really Los Angeles City Hall. The rest of the buildings that stand in for ""Metropolis"" in street scenes were back-lot facades at the old RKO Forty Acres lot in Culver City, which earlier had been Atlanta for _Gone with the Wind (1939)_ (qv), and would later serve as Mayberry for _""The Andy Griffith Show"" (1960)_ (qv).'

934, Flash Gordon. ,Series, Science Fiction, Syn.," The G.B.I. (Galactic Bureau of Investigation) is a 22nd century organization that protects the members of the United Planets from alien invaders. Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Neptune are mentioned members of the alliance, while planets such as Thor, Eben, Diana, Oden and Zerkes are its enemies. Eben is said to pose the biggest threat as it is closest to Earth and only negative gravity protects the Earth from Eben. Commander Paul Richards heads the G.B.I. Flash Gordon, the son of a famous scientist, is its chief operative. Dr.Alexis Zarkov is the agency's chief scientist (inventor of negative gravity) and Dale Arden is his assistant, a scientist almost as brilliant as he. While Dr. Zarkovand Dale always assist Flash on assignments. Dr. Zarkov is always the last one to know what is happening ""because my work at my mountain lab keeps me out of touch with what is going on."" Flash, who wears a T-shirt with a lightning bolt on the front, originally had a rocket ship called the Sky Flash. When it was destroyed in a battle, he had the Sky Flash II (Casey the parrot is its mascot). Although the series is based on the comic strip by Alex Raymond, it differs greatly from the 1936 theatrical serial Flash Gordon. As originally depicted in the film. Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) was the athletic son of Professor Gordon, a world renowned scientist. He had no special powers and belonged to no organization. Steve Holland (TV's Flash Gordon) was like Buster Crabbe, physically right for the role. Dale Arden (Jean Rogers) was beautiful and sexy; she was not a scientist and always in harm's way. Jean, as Dale, was incapable of defending herself and relied on Flash to save her. Irene Champlin (TV's Dale Arden) was not as pretty as Jean Rogers and immediately strikes one as being too old for the part. Irene had dark hair (not blonde like Jean) and differed in the fact that she could defend herself and would jump into harm's way to help someone (Flash and Dr. Zarkov often had to restrain her from getting herself killed). Unlike Jean Rogers, whose character meant dangerous rescue missions for Flash, Irene's Dale was a quick thinker and often saved the trio from perishing. Television's Dr. Zarkov (Joseph Nash) was thinner and younger than one would imagine for one who accomplished so much. In 1936, Dr. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) was somewhat older, a bit heavier and was said to have invented Earth's first rocket ship (which he. Flash and Dale used to travel to the planet Mongo to stop Ming the Merciless from destroying the Earth). The television series was filmed in West Berlin (on a rather cheap budget); Kurt Heuser composed the theme. Cast: Steve Holland {Flash Gordon), Irene Champlin {Dale Arden), Joseph Nash {Dr. Zarkov), Henry Beckman {Paul Richards) .

",1954,1982,[ 'Adventure' 'Biography' 'Drama' 'Family' 'Western'],,"['Shown under five different titles, and eventually appearing on all three of the then-major television networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS), this was, and as of 2005 still is, the longest-running weekly prime time network show in the history of television. ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" has run longer, but that has not been a weekly show in more than forty years.'
 'Several of the longer installments were released as theatrical films overseas.'
 'NBC was loyal to the show throughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s, but by 1979, ratings were declining, and they demanded changes in the format. The studio updated the visual look of the show with a disco theme song and a fancier opening sequence. This convinced NBC to renew the show until 1981. But the ratings did not improve, and NBC cancelled it. CBS then picked it up and featured an even more elaborate opening sequence using then-state-of-the art computer graphics. Disney cancelled the show in 1983, due to the start of The Disney Channel. The show was revived in 1986 on ABC, then moved to NBC in 1988. It was cancelled in 1990 after thirty-six consecutive seasons on network television. In 1997, the show was revived by ABC as _""The Wonderful World of Disney"" (1995)_ (qv).'
 '\'Walt Disney\' (qv)\'s last opening comments aired in ""A Salute to Alaska"", in April 1967, five months after he had passed away.'
 'While declining ratings were a factor in the decision, the show ended primarily because the studio felt it would be competing with the then-new Disney Channel on cable television. Today the Disney Channel rarely shows old Disney films or programs as they used to in the 1980s and 1990s.'
 'Some of the segments produced for this series would be released as shorts in international markets.'
 'The Disney feature-length films were, at first, either edited down to one hour, or broadcast in two or more weekly installments, one hour per week. It was not until the mid 1970s, that Disney Studios finally broadcast one of their feature-length films complete in one evening, the way all other films were usually telecast on network television.'
 'The series was so popular, that in 1972, NBC renewed it through 1976. During this period, Disney was the only Hollywood studio that routinely made money on most of its feature films.'
 'All of the ABC episodes were filmed in color, even though they aired in black and white. In general, ABC did not broadcast in color until the mid 1960s. During the years on ABC, the show went by the title of ""Disneyland"", with one of four weekly sub titles, either ""Fantasyland"", ""Frontierland"", ""Adventureland"", or ""Tomorrowland"", depending on the category of that week\'s show. When the show moved to NBC, in 1961, the different sub titles were dropped. Additionally, many of the ABC episodes that re-aired on NBC were shown in color, and have been that way ever since, even those episodes aired on The Disney Channel, as well as those released in the theater (""The Adventures of Davy Crockett"") and on home video.'
 'From 1954 to 1960, this series was titled ""Disneyland"". It aired on ABC, which, at that time, only broadcasted, for the most part, in black and white.'

The first two seasons of Lassie with the above cast garnered an Emmy award each of those years for best prime time children's show. Lassie never won an Emmy after that. Tommy Rettig was getting too old for the part, so he voluntarily left and was replaced by Timmy and his adoptive parents, the Martins. The critical quality of the show (writing, acting, etc.) began to decline in the third season and suffered considerably when Timmy, the Martins and new producers took over. With the notable exception of a couple of acclaimed Christmas shows the popularity of the dog Lassie and her acting abilities carried the show for many years.

The pilot and two of the plane's three passengers are killed. The lone survivor, a young girl, is found by Logi, the noble chief of the Inoma tribe. Logi names the girl Sheena and raises her to respect good men and hate bad ones. The series begins when Sheena is 28 years old. She is blonde, five feet, nine inches tall and weighs 141 pounds. She measures 39-24-38 and wears a conservative but leg revealing leopard skin dress with a black waist belt that has a cloth attachment to hold her ivory horn (which she uses to summon the animals for help). Sheena also carries a spear and a knife. Sheena, called ""The White Jungle Goddess"" by superstitious natives, is assisted by her pet chimpanzee, Chim (played by Neil). Chim likes to fish and Sheena says that one day he is going to catch ""The Big One."" Sheena's friend. Bob Rayburn was originally depicted as a white trader and made Kenya his home (he bought supplies from the Evans Trading Post). As more unscrupulous characters invaded Africa, Rayburn was said to be a big game hunter who worked on behalf of the Commissioner to ensure the safety of people on safaris. He originally dressed in a black shirt and white pants and carried a knife and handgun; later, his dress is all white and he is armed with a rifle. Sheena prefers to ""move through the trees"" (swing by vine from one to another) rather than walking through the jungle (""Faster my way,"" she says). When Sheena leaves her horn behind it indicates to Bob that she is in trouble. Irish McCalla as Sheena is television's first female superhero.

It may be called the State Police, State Troopers, Militia, the Rangers or the Highway Patrol. These are the stories of the men whose training, skill and courage have enforced and preserved our state laws."" Dramatizations based on the experiences of Highway Patrol officers in all 48 states (at the time of filming). Dan Matthews, a Highway Patrol Chief, is representative of such officers who serve to patrol and protect as members of the Highway Patrol. Cast: Broderick Crawford {Dan Matthews), William Boyett {Sergeant Williams). Narrator: Art Gilmore. Theme Song: ""Highway Patrol"" by Richard Llewellyn. ",1956,,[ 'Action' 'Crime' 'Drama'],,"['Although not given specific screen credit, the California Highway Patrol was pleased to give technical advice on the production, even as far as providing all the patrol vehicles used in the series, and uniforms, too (modified to remove all references to California).'
 'The 1955 Buick Century two-door sedan models used by the Highway Patrol were not made available for sale to the general public.'
 'The California Highway Patrol strongly supported the program in its first two seasons, and the production company was able to rent actual CHP squad cars. Generic ""Highway Patrol"" logos were placed over the real CHP emblems and studio license plates were taped over the genuine ""E"" (exempt) plates. The 1955 Buick Century two-door sedans seen were built especially for the CHP and were never offered for sale to the public. Two-door sedans were adequate because the real CHP rarely arrested anyone at that time, being involved more with accident investigations, enforcement and auto thefts. Major police powers were not invested in the CHP until 1964. The show\'s uniforms were copies of the khakis worn by the CHP including the state seal and the slogan ""Eureka"", except that the word ""California"" was removed. Authenticity was a major goal, and Dan Mathews\' call sign - 21-50 - was the actual unit number of then-CHP Commissioner Bernard Caldwell. In mid-1956 the CHP dropped its support of the program over differences in story lines and presentation, and refused to supply any more squad cars. The producers quickly acquired an incorrect Buick Super four-door hardtop to complete that season. Accurate squad replicas were ordered for the 1957 season, but the 1958-season cars differed from reality. The trailer hitches seen on the squad cars were for towing the film company\'s equipment trailers to shooting locations. Brand names of suspect vehicles were never scripted; they were always described as ""a green coupe"", ""a tan station wagon"" or ""a dark-blue sedan"".'
 'The series\' opening credits originally expressed appreciation to Bernard R. Caldwell (the head of the California Highway Patrol during the mid-1950s) for technical advice and assistance, much of which was provided on-site by CHP Officer Frank Runyon. After the initial seasons, Mr. Runyon continued to serve as a technical advisor but the CHP reduced its official support for the program. The opening expression of gratitude thus became more ""generic"". It read: ""This program is dedicated to the Highway Patrols throughout the nation and their contribution to the safeguarding of public welfare. We are deeply grateful for the technical advice and assistance which made the authentic production of this program possible.""'
 'The production company (ZIV Television Programs, Inc.) made a determined effort to avoid any perception that children or minors were being exploited. The official ZIV writer\'s guide for ""Highway Patrol"" specifically stated that juvenile delinquents were forbidden and that it had to be obvious that any delinquent was an adult. The guide also stated that the show did not do kidnapping stories unless the person kidnapped was obviously an adult.'
 'At the end of the show each week, \'Broderick Crawford (I)\' (qv) would make a safety announcement. One of his famous ones was ""Leave your blood at the Red Cross, not on the highway"". He always ended by saying ""This is Broderick Crawford saying see you next week"".'
 '\'Broderick Crawford (I)\' (qv) played himself _""CHiPs"" (1977) {Hustle (#1.9)}_ (qv), being pulled over for running a stop sign and explaining to Officer Jon Baker ""You know, I was making those Highway Patrol shows long before you were born"". (Baker responded with, ""Yeah, they don\'t make TV programs like that anymore."")'
 'Like \'Broderick Crawford (I)\' (qv) who appeared on _""CHiPs"" (1977)_ (qv) once, \'William Boyett\' (qv) also appeared on the program, appearing a total of three times. In _""CHiPs"" (1977) {The Great 5K Star Race and Boulder Wrap Party: Part 1 (#4.5)}_ (qv) and _""CHiPs"" (1977) {The Great 5K Star Race and Boulder Wrap Party: Part 2 (#4.6)}_ (qv) he played a CalTrans supervisor, and in _""CHiPs"" (1977) {Silent Partner (#5.19)}_ (qv), contrary to his normal police officer role he played a car thief. In between the two, he was best known for playing Sgt. MacDonald, appearing 129 times on _""Adam-12"" (1968)_ (qv).'
 'While it was generally thought the program depicted the California Highway Patrol due to the technical assistance from the CHP and locations filmed in California, on several occasions this was disproved. In _""Highway Patrol"" (1955) {Stolen Car Ring (#2.12)}_ (qv), Matthews says he is from California and just passing through. In _""Highway Patrol"" (1955) {Hitchhiker (#4.27)}_ (qv), the robber from New York that had left a 1,400 mile long trail of robberies tells his wife it is a long way to California. Since it was shown in _""Highway Patrol"" (1955) {Mexican Chase (#4.20)}_ (qv) and _""Highway Patrol"" (1955) {Illegal Entry (#4.28)}_ (qv) that the state bordered Mexico, this leaves as the only possibilities Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. These states can likewise be eliminated. New Mexico uses a state police agency, not a highway patrol. Arizona can be eliminated due to their highway patrol cars of that era being all-white. Texas can be eliminated due to highway patrol officers there not wearing the type of hats shown.'
 'The wall maps Crawford and crew used was actually a map of central Oregon, centered around Prineville and Bend.'
 'Dan Mathews also used the expression, ""21-50, bye,"" at end of transmissions on the radio. Also, he often had to turn his car around in a rapid u-turn to proceed to the scene of the incident. Last, his son had the original patrol car a few years back, and maybe still has it.'

On a ship bound for Old Los Angeles, Don Diego de la Vega, a Spanish nobleman, is returning home to Monterey after three years of study at the University of Spain. He has been summoned by his father, Don Alejandro, to help fight a tyrant, the new comandante, Enrique Monasterio, who has imposed harsh laws and taxes on the people in his quest to become the richest man in California. In his cabin aboard ship, Don Diego tells his mute servant Bernardo that he must find a way to deal with Monasterio without arousing suspicion that his father has summoned him home. Bernardo uses sign language to suggest force _æ ""No, Bernardo. I'm dealing with a powerful enemy. We must play another game."" Just then Don Diego recalls a proverb: ""When you cannot clothe yourself in the skin of a lion, put on that of a fox. I must convince the new comandante that I am perfectly harmless. Instead ofa man of action, I shall be a man of letters, an innocent scholar interested only in the arts and sciences."" With his plan half organized, Don Diego then devises his secret alias, the man who will fight Monasterio _æ ""Zorro _æ the Fox."" He then chooses a black mask and outfit to disguise his true identity. However, to make his plan work, he must also conceal his secret identity from his father. The de la Vegas are the most important family in southern California. Zorro's base is a secret cave below his hacienda in Monterey. Zorro rides a black horse named Tornado and his trademark is the carved sign of the Z. While Zorro is an expert marksman, Don Diego pretends to be inexperienced at fencing. To further cover his tracks as Zorro, Diego teaches Bernardo to play the guitar (to make it appear that Don Diego is in his room practicing when in reality he is out battling injustice as Zorro). Although Zorro helps people, he is considered a criminal by the authorities. Zorro, ""a friend of the people,"" is ""the defender of the oppressed"" and ""the champion of justice."" After battling Monasterio for several months, Zorro finds a new enemy when Enrique is found to be corrupt by the Viceroy (John Dehner) and arrested. Captain Arturo PoUidano, the new magistrate, replaces him and vows to bring the criminal Zorro to justice. Sergeant Demetrio Lopez Garcia is the bumbling second in command, a soldier of the IGng's lancers (he replaces Arturo in second season episodes).

Yancy Derringer, a former Confederate soldier and the owner of a riverboat and plantation, volunteers to help city administrator John Colton institute a system of law and order. Stories relate that aspect. Yancy is assisted by a non-speaking Pawnee Indian named Pahoo-Ka-Ta-Wah (""Wolf Who Stands in Water""). (Pahoo saved Yancy's life at some point within the last eight years. He went against his faith saving a white man and is now responsible for Yancy's life.) Pahoo carries a shotgun with him at all times. The only background information on Yancy is that he was born in New Orleans. He left in 1860, joined the Confederacy, was shot during the Battle of Cold Harbor and spent one year in a Yankee prison. When he got out (possibly in 1865), he went out West to strike it rich but didn't (it was probably at this time that Pahoo saved Yancy's life). Yancy then returned to Louisiana to pick up where he left off. Old Dixie is Yancy's dog, the Sultana is his river-boat and Waverly Plantation is the place of his birth and is his home. Yancy indeed carries a derringer, in his hat, up his sleeve, in his belt and in his boot. He owns a silver mine in Virginia City, Nevada, and buys his fancy ""duds"" at Devereaux's Gentlemen's Apparel. Mme.

Stuart Bailey and Jeff Spencer head the agency. They are assisted by Rex Randolph, Gerald Lloyd Kookson III and Suzanne Fabray. Stuart, called Stu, occupies office 101. He was a former OSS (Office of Strategic Services) agent and now lives in Apartment 301 at the Sunset DeViUa. Stu is a bit reluctant to use force and relies on his intelligence training to accomplish his goals during a case. Jeff occupies office 102. He reads Playboy magazine (surprisingly ""not for the articles"") and $50 is the top price he pays a snitch for information. Jeff and Stu have an eye for the ladies, and girls often tell Jeff ""You're too cute to be a snoop."" Jeff is more adept at physical heroics than Stu, whom he sometimes calls""The Professor"" for his intelligence and ability to speak several languages. Gerald Lloyd Kookson III, better known as Kookie, is the parking lot attendant at Dino's Lodge, the supper club next to 77 Sunset Strip. Kookie lives at 18026 Valley Hart Drive with his unseen mother, Helen Margaret Kookson, a public stenographer; his father is deceased. Kookie drives a hot rod and uses hip talk; for example, ""Squaresville, Man""; ""Like Man, let's get out of here"" and ""I don't dig it."" He refers to Jeff and Stu as ""Hey, Dad"" and pretty girls are ""Dreamboats."" Trouble is ""Troublesville."" Kookie had a way of combing his hair that drove teenage girls in the viewing audience crazy; the song, ""Kookie, Kookie, Lend Me Your Comb"" became a hit. In fourth season episodes, Kookie quits the parking lot business to become partners with Jeff and Stu. J.R. Hale replaced Kookie as the new parking lot attendant at Dino's. Suzanne is a gorgeous French girl who operates the Sunset Answering Service from office 103 at 77 Sunset Strip. She is also a public stenographer and lives in Apartment 217 at 1521/2 North Maple Street, later address given as 236 North Maple, Apartment B.

He sometimes regrets the job and says, ""I should have taken my father's advice and studied air conditioning instead of Nick Carter books."" Stu and Jeff sometimes work for the Pacific Casualty Insurance Company in San Francisco and Pacific Orient Insurance in Los Angeles. In 1963 (to 1964) the format changed to focus on Stu Bailey as a private detective on his own. Although the title remained unchanged, Stu now had an office in downtown Los Angeles in a building called both the Bradbury Building and the Bedford Building. The theme also changed from a snappy vocal composed by Mack David and Jerry Livingston to a musical composition by Bob Thompson. Stu now had a secretary named Hannah and stories were told in a flashback manner. As Stu talked to Hannah, a flashback was used to tell the story. When the flashback ended, Stu and Hannah returned to sum up the case.

 'Stu Bailey and Jeff Spencer were the wisecracking, womanizing private detective heroes of this Warner Brothers drama. Stu and Jeff worked out of an office located at 77 Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, right next door to a snazzy restaurant where Kookie worked as a valet. The finger-snapping, slang-talking Kookie occasionally helped Stu and Jeff with their cases, and eventually became a full-fledged member of the detective agency. Rex Randolph and J.R. Hale also joined the firm, and Suzanne was their leggy secretary.']","[""The restaurant, Dino's Lodge, was then owned by 'Dean Martin (I)' (qv).

 'This series was produced by Warner Brothers for ABC and the episode ""The Kookie Caper"" (episode 2.2, October 9, 1959) has some inside jokes about other series produced by that studio for ABC. Early in episode, Kookie (\'Edd Byrnes\' (qv) indicates that he doesn\'t know that \'Will Hutchins\' (qv) is the star of _""Sugarfoot"" (1957)_ (qv). Later, he can be seen reading an issue of TV Guide, with the stars of _""Maverick"" (1957)_ (qv), \'James Garner (I)\' (qv) and \'Jack Kelly (I)\' (qv), on the cover. Both of those shows were produced by Warner Brothers, as was this one.'
 ""The network handed the creative reigns of the show over to 'Jack Webb (I)' (qv) and 'William Conrad (I)' (qv) for the show's final season. Webb and Conrad proceeded to fire the entire cast except 'Efrem Zimbalist Jr.' (qv), and re-molded his character Stu Bailey into an international spy.""
 ""The character of Stu Bailey originally appeared in one novel and three short stories written by Series Creator 'Roy Huggins (I)' (qv).""
 'Sponsors included Anacin aspirin, Certs breath mints"" with the golden drop of Retsyn"", and Salem Cigarettes.'
 'The ""Dino\'s Lodge"", that featured performances in numerous episodes, often includes the \'Frankie Ortega\' (qv) Trio. The trio were a Los Angeles-based three-piece jazz band signed with Warner Brothers Records, and that often headlined at the real-life Dino\'s during their heyday of the 1950s and 60s.'
 ""The building in which the detectives' offices were located was, in real-life, the home of the Mary Webb Davis modelling agency. The front of the building, the Dino's Lodge driveway, and part of Dino's, were reproduced on a Warner Brothers soundstage, which is where most of the scenes that took place in that area were filmed. The doorknob on the real door was on the left, and that's where it was on the mock-up in the earliest episodes. Later, for some reason, they moved the knob on the soundstage version to the right. The Mary Webb Davis office was eventually replaced by the Tiffany Theatre. The building has since been torn down.""
 ""This was the first of Warner Brothers' formulaic detective series. ABC was so impressed with its success, that they ordered three identical series that differed only in their sunny locales: Bourbon Street Beat (1959), Hawaiian Eye (1959) and Surfside Six (1960). A fourth series, The Roaring 20's (1960) added variety, by taking place in another era.""
 ""Even though Dino's Lodge is shown in every episode, Dean Martin, who owned the lodge, was never on the show, nor even mentioned.""
 ""The ownership battle over the rights to this show was the reason that Roy Huggins left Warner Brothers. He'd created the concept behind the series, and Selby was his creation, but the pilot episode was released theatrically, and had not been written by Huggins at all. lt was a Warner Brothers property because the actual writer had been working for hire and had no legal claim to it, and so legal ownership of the show belonged to them.""
 ""The 6th season shows Stu's office in The Bradbury Building ,a Los Angeles landmark.""

 'When gold was discovered in the Yukon in the 1890s, thousands of hopeful prospectors headed north for a chance at becoming rich.

Adventurers Silky Harris and Reno McKee have arrived in this town looking to make their fortunes. Not mining for gold, but by catering to and fleecing the hardy, hard-living miners who pass through town.']","['The Screen Writers Guild went out on strike in January 1960, and did not settle with the major studios until June 1960.

686, The Untouchables. ,Series, Crime Drama, ABC," Chicago during its turbulent years of mobster rule during the late 1920s and '30s is the setting. Walter Winchell, the program's narrator, tells us that in 1929 the country was dry _æ bootlegged beer had been outlawed _æ but through conveyance with Al Capone, Chicago was wet _æ helped by corrupt officials and a public that was indifferent. To battle Capone and stop his illegal activities, the U.S. District Attorney assigns their top Prohibition Agent, 26-year-old Eliot Ness the task. There are 300 federal agents in Chicago. ""Some can be bought,"" says Ness, ""but what if you have a special squad, small, operating on its own; every man thoroughly investigated; brought in from all parts of the country. Men who will spit on Capone's graft; just a few he can't buy."" On June 28, 1929, Ness is given full access to all federal agents' files. His task: to find six or seven men who are reliable, courageous, dedicated and honest. ""Six or seven of the most honest men."" Several days later, on July 5,  1929, in office 208 of the Federal Building in Washington, D.C., Ness meets with the men he has chosen to become the Federal Special Squad, dubbed ""The Untouchables"" by the press, as they cannot be touched by the mob: Martin Flaherty, a former Boston police oiScer with an outstanding arrest record; William Longfellow, a full-blooded Cherokee Indian, responsible for the breakup of the Oklahoma booze ring; Jack Rossman, a former New York telephone company lineman, now a wiretap expert; Lamar Kane, an agent with the Richmond, Virginia, bureau, a law school graduate, married and the father of two children; Eric Hanson of the San Francisco bureau, a former guard at San Quentin's Death Row Prison; and Enrico Rossi, a former barber who became an agent after he testified as a witness against mobster Frank Nitti. He witnessed a mob hit that claimed the life of an innocent 17 -yearold girl.

Joe was killed off and Tom was dropped. They were replaced by agents Lee Hobson (Paul Picerni) and Cam Allison (Anthony George). At the age of 26, Eliot Ness headed the most elite crime fighting unit in the country. While it took him 18 months to bring Capone to justice (nailing him on an income tax evasion charge), Ness fought corruption until his death in 1957. The team was first dubbed ""The Untouchables"" by the Chicago Bulletin when it ran the headline ""Untouchables Defy Capone."" Al Capone had his headquarters in a room above the Montmartre Cafe in Chicago. When caught by Ness, he was sentenced to 11 years in the Atlanta State Penitentiary. Eliot dated Betty Anderson (Patricia Crowley) and married her in November of 1929. In the pilot episode.

 'According to testimony from \'Aladena Fratianno\' (qv)--aka ""Jimmy the Weasel""--a Mafia boss turned FBI informant, the Chicago family of the Mafia ordered the assassination of the show\'s producer \'Desi Arnaz\' (qv) because they didn\'t like (a) the fact that the success of the show was focusing attention on the Mafia, and (b) the show\'s portrayal of Italians. Fratianno said that two hitmen hid themselves near Arnaz\'s house one night waiting for him to show up, but he never did. Shortly afterwards the assassination order was rescinded when it was realized that Arnaz\'s murder would cause the Mafia more trouble than it was worth.'
 'This show was under constant attack by various groups that claimed it defamed the image of Italians and Italian-Americans.'
 'Among the concessions made to Italian-American groups, the network and producers were allowed to use Italians and Italian names for criminals based upon real persons but agreed that fictional criminal characters would be non-Italians.'
 ""To counter some of the claims that the show was anti-Italian, later episodes gave a more prominent role to Agent Enrico Rossi (the Italian-American member of Ness' team) in order to show an Italian-American as a hero working for law and order.

 'In the series Elliott Ness was portrayed as an FBI Special Agent, but in truth worked as an agent for the Treasury Department.'
 'This series was (very loosely) based on the book Ness co-wrote with journalist Oscar Fraley (who, in turn, confessedly ""embellished"" Ness\' role into the fall of Capone). In spite of Fraley\'s additions, in the book, Ness and his eleven agents are not reported as doing much more than busting alcohol shipments and depots, yet the series had Ness intervening in dozens of totally fictional events.
